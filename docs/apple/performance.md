# Performance on the Apple clients

The rules for keeping the iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac and Vision Pro apps (`apple/`) responsive. Every person and Agent
changing `apple/` code reads this first. A PR that touches `apple/` names the rules it followed (`P1`…`P12`) and every
deviation with its reason. A performance-sensitive change also attaches before and after measurements ("Measuring").

The rules come from this repository's own regressions (`docs/lessons/ios.md`, `docs/lessons/macos.md`,
`docs/apple/ios-state.md`, the `perf(…)` PRs) and from Apple's guidance ("Sources"). Each rule says what to do, why,
where this repository got it wrong (file:line on `main` when written, 2026-11-11), the correct pattern and how to check it.
The full list of current problems the rules found is in "Survey of the current code".

## Rules at a glance

| Rule | In one line | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | No system-framework or disk IO on the main actor; `.task` and `async` do not move work off it | ratchet, review, Time Profiler |
| P2 | Keychain and UserDefaults: read once, off the hot path; nothing that changes often goes in UserDefaults | ratchet, review |
| P3 | `@State` initial values are cheap and have no side effects | review, `PerfTrace.body` counts |
| P4 | `body` only arranges views: no sorting, parsing, formatting or decoding in it | review, SwiftUI instrument |
| P5 | A view reads only what it draws; split readers into small views | `RenderBudgetTests`, `AllSessionsReadersTests` |
| P6 | Lists have stable, unique identities and cheap rows | review, `PerfTrace.body` counts |
| P7 | Coalesce high-frequency updates; no state ↔ layout feedback loops | `PerfCount` push time, review |
| P8 | Decode and downsample images off the main thread, to the pixel size drawn, and cache them | ratchet, Allocations |
| P9 | Timers, polling and animations stop when nobody sees them | ratchet, `ContinuousMotionTests`, `HoldSourceTests` |
| P10 | Launch draws the first frame before doing anything else | App Launch template, `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` |
| P11 | Caches and retained pages are bounded; extensions decode to the size they show | Allocations, Leaks, memory graph |
| P12 | Performance claims come with measurements from an optimized build | PR review |

## Budgets

The numbers a change must stay within. Frame and hang thresholds follow Apple's; the push and memory budgets are this
repository's.

| What | Budget | Measure with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One main-thread work item during scrolling, typing or an animation | ≤ 16 ms (one frame at 60 Hz; 8 ms on 120 Hz ProMotion screens is the goal) | Time Profiler, Animation Hitches, `FrameStats` |
| Any single main-thread block, anywhere (first tap, page open, push) | < 100 ms; Apple calls a delay over 100 ms noticeable | `MainThreadWatchdog`, Time Profiler, Hangs instrument, `sample <pid>` |
| A hang | none ≥ 250 ms, the point where Apple's tools report a hang; one found is a bug to fix before release | Hangs instrument, Xcode Organizer, MetricKit |
| Hitch time ratio while scrolling | < 5 ms/s (Apple: good under 5, warning 5–10, critical above 10) | `XCTHitchMetric`, `scripts/app/perf-test.sh` |
| View bodies per hub push, page at rest | the numbers in `docs/apple/ios-state.md` ("Cost of one push"): Agents list 1 / 2, chats 0 | `RenderBudgetTests` |
| Main-thread time per hub push | no regression against the tables in `docs/operations/testing.md` ("Whole App (any page)") | `-perfCounts YES`, `-showPagePerf YES` |
| Launch to first frame | target < 400 ms warm on a recent iPhone (Apple's launch target); no IO, keychain or migration before it | App Launch template, `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric`, Organizer |
| Memory after leaving a page | opening and closing the same page 10 times ends within 5 MB of where it started; no leaked stores in the memory graph | Allocations (generations), memory graph |
| Extensions (widgets, share, notification service, Live Activity) | decode only at the size drawn, never a full-size picture; extensions run under far tighter memory limits than the app | Memory gauge, `XCTMemoryMetric` |

These are measured in the simulator unless a device is named. Simulator numbers compare a change against its base
(same machine, same simulator, same build settings). They are not phone numbers: report them as simulator numbers.

## Rules

### P1. No system-framework or disk IO on the main actor

**Rule.** Photos (`PHAsset.fetch…`, `PHPhotoLibrary`), Contacts, EventKit (`authorizationStatus` included), HealthKit
queries, `FileManager` listings and attributes, `Data(contentsOf:)` / `String(contentsOf:)`, large `JSONDecoder` runs and
SQLite / Core Data fetches never run on the main actor. A `.task { }` modifier and an `async` method of a MainActor type
run on the main actor: `async` does not mean off the main thread.

**Why.** App targets default to MainActor (`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION: MainActor` in `apple/project.yml`), so any
call written in a view, a model or an app-target helper runs on the main thread. Many framework calls are synchronous
XPC to a system daemon: their cost depends on the daemon, not on the app. The first time a process opens the Photos
database the fetch can take over a second.

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:79-89`: `AttachLibrary.fetch()` runs `PHAsset.fetchAssets` and enumerates
  the result on the main actor, started by `.task { await library.load() }` at `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:222`.
  The first tap on the composer's + blocked the main thread for about 1.3 s while Photos opened its database (#4250).
- `apple/Persona/PhoneTools/PhotosTool.swift:64`: the hub's photo-listing tool fetches on the main actor too (`PhotosTool`
  is MainActor by default); a request from an Agent stalls whatever the user is doing.
- Fixed before: `EKEventStore.authorizationStatus` asked five times on the main thread when registering the phone's
  tools (commit `e2426cd21`).

**Do.** Put the IO in a `nonisolated` function (or `@concurrent` on Swift 6.2) and hand back a `Sendable` value; publish it
to the observable model on the main actor:

```swift
/// PHAsset is immutable and safe to pass between threads, but not marked Sendable.
struct Assets: @unchecked Sendable { let list: [PHAsset] }

@Observable final class AttachLibrary {
    private(set) var assets: [PHAsset] = []
    func fetch() async {
        assets = await Self.newest(limit: Theme.Attach.fetchLimit).list   // published on the main actor
    }
    @concurrent nonisolated static func newest(limit: Int) async -> Assets {
        // PHFetchOptions, PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:) and enumerateObjects, all on a background thread
    }
}
```

Start the work before the user needs it where it is free to do so (prefetch when the composer appears, not when + is
tapped), and show the panel at once with a placeholder.

**Check.** `scripts/test/test_apple_perf_patterns.py` keeps the count of these calls per file from growing ("Automated
checks"). In review: every new call to a system framework or the file system names the thread it runs on. Measure with
Time Profiler (main thread, "Hide system libraries" off) or `sample <pid>` during the first tap on a cold launch.

### P2. Keychain and UserDefaults: read once, off the hot path

**Rule.** Keychain reads (`SecItemCopyMatching`) happen once per launch or change, off the main thread or before the first
frame is needed, and the result is cached in memory. Values that change often (scroll positions, drafts, split frames,
counters) never go into UserDefaults: use `StateCache` (`apple/Shared/StateCache.swift`). Heavy views read settings
through `@StoredValue` (`apple/Persona/App/StoredValue.swift`), not `@AppStorage`. Never call `synchronize()`.

**Why.** A keychain read is IPC to `securityd` and can take tens of milliseconds, more while the device is locking or
unlocking. Every UserDefaults write, for any key, makes every `@AppStorage` view in the app recompute.

**Counter-examples.**
- Fixed before: the Mac's split view wrote its column frames to UserDefaults on every frame of a window resize (180–350
  writes in 4 s) and recomputed Settings and the inbox each time (commit `627c1a802`, `docs/lessons/macos.md`).
- Fixed before: `AgentSync` wrote UserDefaults on every chat fetch (`docs/apple/ios-state.md`, "Current data flow").
- `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:277`: writes UserDefaults on every set of the current conversation, changed or not.

**Do.** One reader, `Keychain` (`apple/Shared/Keychain.swift`), called from the code that loads credentials at launch or
pairing; keep the value in the model and pass it down. For new persisted state pick `StateCache` first.

**Check.** The ratchet counts `SecItemCopyMatching` and `synchronize()`; `AppStorageRatchetTests` keeps the list of files
holding `@AppStorage` from growing. Review: no `@AppStorage` key written more than once per user action; no keychain read reachable from `body`, a row, or a push handler.

### P3. `@State` initial values are cheap and have no side effects

**Rule.** The expression after `@State var x =` must be cheap and side-effect free. Classes stored in `@State` get a
trivial `init`: no framework objects, IO, subscriptions, timers or logging. Expensive set-up runs once, in `.task` or in the
owner's model, and the view holds an optional until then.

**Why.** SwiftUI evaluates the initial value every time the view's struct is created, which is every time its parent's
`body` runs, and throws away every instance but the first. Apple's `State` documentation says so and recommends `.task`
for expensive objects.

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift:4168`: `@State private var attachPanel = AttachPanel()` in `Composer`;
  `AttachPanel` was constructed 17–20 times in one launch because the composer is rebuilt with the chat.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:173`: `@State private var library = AttachLibrary()` creates a
  `PHCachingImageManager` (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:66`) every time the sheet's struct is created.
- Fixed before: `ShellState(...)` as a `@State` initial value called the pager and a DEBUG trace on every `RootView`
  rebuild, which kept the main thread at 100% (commit `d2289dee5`, `docs/lessons/ios.md`).

**Do.** Keep the model's `init` empty and create its expensive parts lazily (`@ObservationIgnored private lazy var
manager = PHCachingImageManager()`), or own the object one level up (the page's model) and pass it in.

**Check.** Review: open every class used as a `@State` initial value and read its `init`. To measure, log or count the
`init` in DEBUG (`PerfTrace.event`) and open the page: more than one instance per page open is the bug.

Automated: `scripts/test/test_apple_state_initial_values.py` matches `@State … = T(…)` against classes declared under
`apple/`. An `init` is trivial only when empty or made of assignments without calls or blocks; an eager stored-property
initial value is non-trivial if it contains a function/constructor call or a block. This deliberately counts even cheap
value constructors. Static/lazy properties, stored closure bodies, property observers, computed properties and ordinary
methods are excluded; comments and literal string contents are ignored (interpolations count as calls). This is a lexical
check, not overload, inheritance or default-argument analysis; same-named classes are treated together. Review remains required.

### P4. `body` only arranges views

**Rule.** No sorting, filtering, grouping or counting over collections, no `DateFormatter` / `NumberFormatter` creation,
no `Regex` / `NSRegularExpression` compilation, no Markdown or `AttributedString` parsing, no JSON and no image decoding
in `body` or in computed properties `body` calls. Derive once per change in the model and store the result.

**Why.** `body` runs whenever anything it read changes, and in lists for every row that is laid out. Work in it is paid on
every push and every frame of a scroll.

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkInline.swift:303`: compiles a regular expression on every call, from every Lark card node's `body`.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Knowledge/KnowledgeView.swift:1092`: a new `DateFormatter` per call from `body` (`apple/Persona/Views/Knowledge/KnowledgeView.swift:826`).
- Fixed before: the Agents list grouped, sorted, folded and counted every session in `body` on every push until `AgentsFeed` and
  `AgentListProjection` moved that into the model (`docs/apple/ios-state.md`, steps 1 and 3); Markdown re-parsed finished blocks while streaming until `StreamChunks`.

**Do.** Derived data lives in the model (`AgentsFeed`, `AgentListProjection`, `AppModel.badges`), keyed by a small revision,
derived off the main actor when large (`docs/lessons/ios.md`, "Cached Agent-list projections (#1231)"). Formatters are
`static let`, or use `Date.FormatStyle`, which caches.

**Check.** Review. Measure with the SwiftUI instrument (Xcode 26: long view body updates) or `PerfTrace.body` counts with
`-perfCounts YES`.

### P5. A view reads only what it draws

**Rule.** Observation tracks every property a `body` reads. A view reads the narrowest value it draws: one session's cell
(`model.session(_:)`), not `allSessions`; `namedMachine(_:)`, not `machines`. When a big view needs one fast-changing value
in one place, move that read into a small child view. Actions read unobserved values when tapped (`model.sessionsNow`,
`AppModel.latest(_:)`): observed for display, unobserved for actions. Never write observable state in `body`.

**Why.** One read of a fast-changing property makes the whole view recompute on every change of it.

**Counter-examples.**
- Fixed before: `ChatView`'s footer read `model.drafts[key]`, so each keystroke redrew the cards, the dock and the
  composer's wrapper; the read moved into `DraftReader` (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift:6123`, commit `ff5aa0071`).
- Fixed before: the chat subtitle read `machines`, so every machine heartbeat recomputed the page and all its rows
  (`docs/apple/ios-state.md`, step 5); writing a trace array in `body` made `RootView` observe it and redraw for ever (commit `d2289dee5`).

**Do.** Follow `docs/apple/ios-state.md` ("Keeping redraws small"). Write-only records are `@ObservationIgnored`. A store
many pages share hands each one a projection of its own key, built per change: `MeetingPhotos.Album` is one recording's
photos with each row's content worked out, so the meeting thread reads only their order, each photo row reads the rest,
and another recording's uploads redraw neither.

**Check.** `RenderBudgetTests` (views per push) and `AllSessionsReadersTests` (who may read `allSessions`) fail on
regressions; add a `PerfTrace.body("Name")` to a new heavy view so its count shows up.

### P6. Lists have stable identities and cheap rows

**Rule.** `ForEach` / `List` ids are stable, unique model ids: no `id: \.offset` over a collection that inserts, removes or
reorders, no `id: \.self` over values that change, no `UUID()` made in `body`. No `AnyView` in rows. Heavy rows are
`Equatable` (or take only `Equatable` inputs) so a push that does not change them does not redraw them. Many rows are
separate lazy rows, never one child view holding hundreds of them.

**Why.** An identity that shifts makes SwiftUI treat every row after an insertion as new: state is lost, rows animate
wrongly and all are rebuilt. `AnyView` hides the type, so SwiftUI cannot diff the row cheaply.

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ComposerParts.swift:168`: the composer's attached images, which can be removed, use `id: \.offset`.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkCard.swift:305-335`: Lark cards inside chat rows are trees of `AnyView`.
- Fixed before: one `VStack` of all rows inside a `LazyVStack` laid out hundreds of rows at once and blanked the page (`docs/lessons/ios.md`, "Chat lists and scrolling").
- Fixed before: an Agent's 33,000-character report was one row (one MarkdownUI document laid out whole, twice, with every table's decoration
  re-run per scrolled frame); long finished answers are now lazy rows of about 24 lines (`AnswerParts`, #4970).

**Do.** Give each element an `Identifiable` id from the hub (`SessionKey`, item ids). `\.offset` is fine only over a
constant array built in the same expression (a fixed set of chips).

**Check.** Review. Measure a scroll with `XCTHitchMetric` (`scripts/app/perf-test.sh`) and row body counts.

### P7. Coalesce high-frequency updates; no feedback loops

**Rule.** Streams that can arrive faster than a frame (hub pushes, streaming deltas, progress, scroll and geometry
callbacks) are coalesced before they touch observable state, and only assigned when the value changed. State written from
layout (`onGeometryChange`, preferences) is quantized, so writing it cannot change the layout that reported it.

**Why.** Each assignment of an observed property schedules a SwiftUI update; ten in one frame cost ten updates. A layout
value written back into state that changes the layout loops for ever and hangs the app.

**Counter-examples.**
- Fixed before: a card's password field hung the app because the pending cards' height and the footer's height were
  written back with different tolerances and cycled with period 4 (commit `4939f5960`).
- Fixed before: each machine's session list landed as its own SwiftUI update; they now coalesce for 25 ms
  (`AppModel.sessionsCoalesce`, `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:1646`).

**Do.** Batch into one main-actor hop per frame or per short window (`applyPendingSessions`); compare before assigning;
round geometry to whole points and write it back only when it moved by at least a point.

**Check.** `-perfCounts YES` push time and bodies; the mock hub's `/mock/churn` and `/mock/say?stream=1` drive the load
(`docs/operations/testing.md`, "Persona page (long main chat)").

### P8. Decode and downsample images off the main thread

**Rule.** Pictures from data or files are decoded and downsampled to the pixel size they are drawn at, off the main
thread (ImageIO `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex`), and cached in an `NSCache` with a cost. `UIImage(data:)`,
`UIImage(contentsOfFile:)` and `preparingForDisplay()` do not run in `body`, a row or on the main actor.

**Why.** A decoded picture costs width × height × 4 bytes whatever its file size (a 12 MP photo is about 48 MB) and the
decode takes tens of milliseconds. `UIImage(data:)` decodes lazily at first draw, on the main thread.

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Persona/Persona/PersonaStore.swift:566`: `avatar(_:points:scale:)` reads and decodes the avatar file and calls
  `preparingForDisplay()` on the main actor; `apple/Persona/Persona/PersonaViews.swift:19` calls it from `body`, so the
  first draw of each avatar decodes on the main thread (cached afterwards).
- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkAttachmentView.swift:33` and `apple/Persona/Views/Session/CompareView.swift:249`: `UIImage(data:)` in `body`, on every render.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/PhotoAttach.swift:35`: picked photos decoded, scaled and encoded on the main actor.

**Do.** Follow `LarkMedia` (`apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkMedia.swift:101-120`): download, then
`Task.detached { decode(data, maxPixel:) }` with a `nonisolated` ImageIO thumbnail, in-flight requests shared, an `NSCache`
with a byte cost. Photos thumbnails come from `PHCachingImageManager` at the cell's pixel size.

**Check.** The ratchet counts `UIImage(data:)` / `UIImage(contentsOfFile:)` / `NSImage(data:)`. Allocations shows
full-size `CGImage` backing stores.

### P9. Work stops when nobody sees it

**Rule.** Timers, polling, `TimelineView(.animation)` and view-scoped `Task`s run only while their page is in front and the
scene is active: `.tabActiveTask` and `.onTabVisibility` (`apple/Persona/Views/TabActivity.swift:101-112`), not
`onAppear` / `onDisappear` (hidden tabs never get `onDisappear`). Every `TimelineView(.animation…)` has a `paused:`
argument; every unending animation is listed in `ContinuousMotionTests`. Timers are invalidated; long loops check
`Task.isCancelled`; closures stored on `self` capture `[weak self]`.

**Why.** Retained tabs and pages stay mounted. Work behind them costs battery and main-thread time on every page; on the Mac
a running `TimelineView(.animation)` relayouts the window every frame (`docs/lessons/macos.md`).

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Packages/BeautifulUI/Sources/BeautifulUI/Components/PromptBar.swift:811`: a `TimelineView(.animation(minimumInterval: 1 / 30))`
  with no `paused:`.
- `apple/PersonaWatch/PersonaWatchApp.swift:285-288`: an endless poll whose `try?` sleep swallows cancellation.
- Fixed before: hidden chats kept their transcript subscription and read owner after a tab switch (`docs/lessons/ios.md`,
  "Retained chat visibility").

**Do.** `.tabActiveTask { … }` for polling; `TimelineView(.animation(paused: !visible || reduceMotion))`; persistent
animations on the Mac in Core Animation (`MacBreathingRing`).

**Check.** The ratchet counts `TimelineView(.animation…)` without `paused:`; `ContinuousMotionTests`; `HoldSourceTests`
(no timers in model-following feeds). Leaks and the memory graph after leaving the page.

### P10. Launch draws the first frame first

**Rule.** `App.init`, the app delegate's launch callbacks and the first scene's first `body` do only what the first frame
needs: read the cached snapshot (`StateCache`) and show it. Network, keychain reads beyond the hub token, migrations,
registering phone tools, extension discovery and prefetching start after the first frame, from a `.task`, off the main
actor.

**Why.** The system measures launch to the first frame (Xcode Organizer, MetricKit) and kills an app that takes too long to
launch. Everything before the first frame is time the user stares at the launch screen.

**Counter-examples.**
- `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:2107` and `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:3078`: the drafts, quotes and comments files are each read and decoded twice while `AppModel` initializes.
- `apple/PersonaWatch/PersonaWatchApp.swift:6`: the watch's `WatchModel()` reads the keychain and the pet manifest and starts polling in `init`.

**Do.** Show the cached state, then connect. Mark launch phases with `PerfTrace.event` so Instruments' Points of Interest
show where the time went.

**Check.** The App Launch template in Instruments (simulator or device), `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` in a UI test, and the
launch histogram in Xcode Organizer for TestFlight builds.

### P11. Bounded memory

**Rule.** Every cache has a bound in entries and bytes (`NSCache` with `totalCostLimit`, or a bounded LRU as in commit
`02730aa09` for Markdown highlights). Pages that stay mounted release their large data when hidden and fetch it again
(`since_seq`) when shown. Extensions (widgets, share, notification service, Live Activity) decode images only at the size
they draw and never load whole transcripts.

**Why.** iOS ends a process that grows past its memory limit without a crash report the user sees; extensions get much
lower limits than the app. A cache with no bound is a leak with extra steps.

**Do.** Give caches a cost; drop them on `UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification`; release retained stores on
`onTabVisibility` disappear. Full-size decodes of user pictures run one at a time and let the original go as soon as it
is downscaled (`MeetingPhotos` prepares a pick's photos in turn, and `MeetingPhotoPipeline.prepare` drops the original
before Vision reads the small copy), so four 48 MP photos picked during a recording never sit in memory at once.

**Check.** Allocations with generations (open and close a page 10 times; "Budgets"), the memory graph debugger for leaked
stores and models, `XCTMemoryMetric` for a scenario test.

### P12. Measure what you claim

**Rule.** A PR that says it makes something faster, or that touches a hot path (chat list, composer, Agents list, push
handling, launch, images), attaches before and after numbers: same machine, same simulator or device, optimized build,
at least three runs each, worst case as well as median. A change without a measurable gain says so ("less gets redrawn,
but no frame-rate gain could be measured", as commit `ff5aa0071` did).

**Why.** Debug `-Onone` numbers and single runs mislead; simulator variance between runs is large.

**Check.** PR review against "Measuring".

## Measuring

Start from a reproduction, measure the base, change one thing, measure again.

1. **Build optimized.** `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL=-O SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE=wholemodule` in a separate DerivedData, or
   `scripts/app/perf-test.sh`, which builds that way. Default Debug numbers are not comparable (`docs/operations/testing.md`,
   "Jank measurement (dropped frames)").
2. **Use your own simulator** through `scripts/app/sim-boot.sh` and an isolated mock hub (`scripts/mock/mock_hub.py` on your
   own port) with heavy data (`MOCK_AGENTS=1`, `MOCK_LONG_ASSISTANT=1`, `MOCK_LONG_HISTORY=1`).
   Before measuring, check that the app is active (`scripts/app/personactl.py`'s `state` answers `appState: active`). An app
   left inactive, for example under an unanswered system prompt (#5089), keeps its hub links suspended and measures nothing;
   restart the simulator with `sim-boot.sh --reslim`, or use `--profile stock`.
3. **Find the main thread's time.**
   - `sample <pid> 10 1 -file out.txt` while reproducing: no Instruments authorization needed; aggregate the main thread.
   - Instruments: Time Profiler (attach to the simulator app's PID); Hangs (reports main-thread blocks over the
     threshold you set, 250 ms by default; set it lower to find 100 ms blocks); SwiftUI (Xcode 26: view body updates,
     their causes and long updates); App Launch; Allocations and Leaks. Animation Hitches needs a device.
   - Signposts: `PerfTrace.event("Name", detail)` (`apple/Persona/App/PerfSignpost.swift`, subsystem `Persona.Performance`,
     Points of Interest) marks moments. For a span, use an `OSSignposter` interval in the same subsystem, compiled under
     `#if DEBUG || PERF_SIGNPOST`.
4. **Count redraws.** Add `PerfTrace.body("ViewName")` at the top of a heavy `body`; launch with `-perfCounts YES`.
   `PerfCount` counts bodies and the main thread's time from each push to the next idle run loop.
5. **Catch main-thread blocks.** DEBUG and PERF_SIGNPOST builds start `MainThreadWatchdog` with the root view. A background
   thread pings the main run loop every 25 ms. If a ping takes at least 100 ms, the watchdog suspends the main Mach thread,
   copies its registers and frame-pointer chain, resumes it, and symbolicates the addresses afterwards. Raw addresses and a
   `PerfTrace.event` are recorded before symbolication, so a persistent hang is visible before the main thread answers again;
   the answer's own timestamp supplies the final duration without the sampler's overhead. Healthy pings capture no stack and
   emit no event. A block appears as `main_thread_blocks` in
   `PerfCount`, and is attached to each `FrameProbe` run in `frames.json`. Reports keep the five longest blocks and 32 frames
   per stack. `PerfAssistantTests/testWelcomePageIdle` asserts that every measured run has zero such blocks; other suites
   attach the data without enforcing the budget yet.
6. **Automate it (the probe-script pattern).** A DEBUG launch argument runs the scenario inside the app and writes its
   numbers to a file (`-showAutoScroll YES` → `Documents/frames.json` from `FrameStats`; `-showPagePerf YES` →
   `frames-page-*.json`); a script launches the app, drives the mock hub (`/mock/churn`, `/mock/say?stream=1`), waits with a
   timeout, reads the file and ends with a one-line verdict. Screen probes (`-probes YES`, `docs/apple/ios-state.md`,
   "Probes and assertions") expose state for UI tests. The suites in `scripts/app/perf-test.sh` (`PerfAgentsTests`,
   `PerfAssistantTests`, `PerfComposerTests`, …) do this with `XCTHitchMetric` and report through
   `scripts/app/perf_report.py`.
7. **In the field.** TestFlight builds report hangs, launch time and memory to Xcode Organizer. MetricKit is not wired yet
   (#4265).

Report the device or simulator, OS, build settings, data set, number of runs and the range, and say what was not measured.

## Automated checks

| Check | What it does | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/test/test_apple_perf_patterns.py` | Ratchet over Swift under `apple/` (tests excluded): Photos fetches, `SecItemCopyMatching`, `Data` / `String(contentsOf:)`, directory listings, `UserDefaults.synchronize()`, `UIImage(data:)` / `(contentsOfFile:)` / `NSImage(data:)`, and `TimelineView(.animation…)` without `paused:`. Each file's counts (`scripts/test/apple_perf_baseline.json`) may only go down; a call verified to run off the main thread is marked `// perf-ok: <reason>`. After removing calls, run it with `--update`; `--list` prints every counted call. Runs in `scripts/ci/python-tests.py`. | Implemented |
| `RenderBudgetTests`, `AllSessionsReadersTests`, `AppStorageRatchetTests`, `HoldSourceTests`, `ContinuousMotionTests` | Views per push, who reads `allSessions`, files still holding `@AppStorage`, no self-managed waits, every unending animation stops under Reduce Motion | Existing |
| `scripts/app/perf-test.sh` | Scroll, navigation and composer hitches per page | Existing, run by hand |
| Isolation-aware lint | Flag the patterns above only where the compiler says the call is on the main actor (SwiftSyntax or a SourceKit index over the isolation of the enclosing declaration), so the ratchet can become a hard zero | Proposed, #4262 |
| `scripts/test/test_apple_state_initial_values.py` | P3 ratchet over Swift under `apple/`, including tests: class construction in `@State` with non-trivial `init` bodies or eager stored-property initial values. Each file/type count (`scripts/test/apple_state_initial_values_baseline.json`) may only go down; new entries start at zero. `--update` lowers the baseline; `--list` prints every counted site and its reason. Automatically discovered by `scripts/ci/python-tests.py` in the scripts lane. | Implemented, #4263 |
| DEBUG main-thread watchdog | A background thread pings the main run loop and logs a `PerfTrace.event` plus a main-thread sample when it is blocked over 100 ms, so UI tests and runtime CLI scenarios catch blocks without Instruments | Implemented, #4264 |
| MetricKit | Subscribe `MXMetricManager` in TestFlight builds; send hang (`MXHangDiagnostic`), launch and memory payloads into Copy Diagnostics | Proposed, #4265 |
| Launch metric | A UI test with `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` in `scripts/app/perf-test.sh` | Proposed, #4266 |

## Review checklist

Paste into a PR that touches `apple/`, marking each item done, not applicable, or deviated (with the reason):

- [ ] P1 / P2: no new system-framework call, file read, keychain read or UserDefaults write on the main actor, from `body`, a row or a push handler.
- [ ] P3: every new `@State` initial value is cheap and side-effect free.
- [ ] P4 / P5: no new work in `body`; new reads of fast-changing model properties are in the smallest view that draws them.
- [ ] P6: new lists use stable model ids; no `id: \.offset` over changing data, no `AnyView` rows.
- [ ] P7 / P9: new streams are coalesced; new timers, polling and animations stop when hidden (`.tabActiveTask`, `paused:`).
- [ ] P8 / P11: new images are downsampled off the main thread and cached with a bound.
- [ ] P10: nothing new runs before the first frame.
- [ ] P12: a performance-sensitive change has before / after numbers ("Measuring"), or says why none.

## Survey of the current code

What the rules found on `main` on 2026-11-11. Each line is a problem to fix (tracked in #4267), not an exemption; a PR
that fixes one removes its line.

Grep counts are across `apple/` without tests; they are leads to read, not each a bug.

**P1: system-framework and disk IO on the main actor**

- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:79-89`: `PHAsset.fetchAssets` and enumeration of the result on the main actor, from `.task` (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:222`); about 1.3 s on the first tap of + (#4250).
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:586`: picking a photo runs `PHAsset.fetchAssets(withLocalIdentifiers:)` (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:150`) once for every photo already picked.
- `apple/Persona/PhoneTools/PhotosTool.swift:64`: the hub's photo-listing tool fetches and enumerates on the main actor; `apple/Persona/PhoneTools/PhotosTool.swift:136-140` decodes the full photo, resizes it and encodes JPEG there too.
- `apple/Persona/PhoneTools/CalendarTool.swift:123-125`: `EKEventStore()` and the synchronous `events(matching:)` over the asked range on the main actor; a new `EKEventStore` per call (also lines 162, 232, 355, 378, 395, 404).
- `apple/Persona/Views/Assistant/Tasks/TodayCard.swift:190`: a new `EKEventStore` on the main actor each time the card's `.task` runs.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Session/ReviewModel.swift:124`: every change to a review's drafts reads and decodes the whole drafts file, then writes it (`apple/Persona/Views/Session/ReviewModel.swift:222`).
- Good: `apple/Persona/PhoneTools/ContactsTool.swift:124` (`nonisolated` fetch), `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/QuickLookFile.swift:227` (`Task.detached` file read).

**P2: keychain and UserDefaults**

- `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:277`: `assistantCurrent` writes UserDefaults on every set, even when the value did not change; `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:229` writes `dev.openChat` on every chat open. Each write recomputes every `@AppStorage` view (49 remain, most in `apple/Persona/Views/Session/SessionPanes.swift` and `apple/Persona/Views/Session/Terminal/TerminalExtras.swift`).
- `apple/PersonaWatch/PersonaWatchApp.swift:196`: the watch writes its whole seen-card list to UserDefaults on each refresh that finds new cards.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Machines/ScreenCredentials.swift:36`: a keychain read on the main actor when Screen Sharing opens (once per tap; minor).

**P3: `@State` initial values**

- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift:4168`: `AttachPanel()` built 17–20 times in one launch (its `init` is trivial; the waste is the repeated allocation).
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:173`: `AttachLibrary()` creates a `PHCachingImageManager` (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/AttachSheet.swift:66`) for each discarded instance.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Settings/NotificationSettingsView.swift:16`: `ActivityAuthorizationInfo().areActivitiesEnabled`, a system query, on every init of the view.
- `apple/PersonaWatch/PersonaWatchApp.swift:6`: `WatchModel()` reads the keychain, reads and decodes the pet manifest (`apple/PersonaWatch/WatchPetView.swift:19`) and starts its polling loop in `init`, before the watch app's first frame.
- About 130 other `@State … = SomeClass()` were read: their `init`s only store values.

**P4: work in `body`**

- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkInline.swift:303`: `cardMarkdown` compiles an `NSRegularExpression` on every call, and another per attribute (`apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkInline.swift:310`), for every card node's `body` (`apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkCard.swift:327`). 45 uncached `NSRegularExpression(` sites in all.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Knowledge/KnowledgeView.swift:1092`: a new `DateFormatter` per call, from `body` (`apple/Persona/Views/Knowledge/KnowledgeView.swift:826`); same in `apple/Persona/Views/Settings/ExtensionCodeViews.swift:382-389` (`ISO8601DateFormatter`, `RelativeDateTimeFormatter`).
- `apple/Shared/Models.swift:2505`: `storageText` creates a `ByteCountFormatter` on each read; 35 callers, many in rows and in a progress label (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/VideoFileView.swift:145`).
- `apple/Persona/Views/Session/ReviewPage.swift:267-283`: rebuilds a file's diff rows, scans them for the widest line number and filters the drafts once per line, on every `body`.
- Counts: 22 `DateFormatter()`, 13 `ISO8601DateFormatter()`.
- Good: `ChatScratch`'s memoized lines (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift:880`), `TextMemo` (`apple/Shared/TextMemo.swift`), `InboxProjectionMemo`.

**P5 / P7: reads and high-frequency updates**

- `apple/Persona/Views/Chats/ChatsView.swift:4344`: every scroll frame writes `header.scrolled`, which `AgentsFoldingField` observes, so that field's `body` runs every frame, folded or not.
- `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:1868-1872`: each `screen` event sets three observed properties with no pacing (who reads them not yet checked).
- Good: stream deltas are paced (`apple/Persona/App/DeltaPacer.swift`, 200 ms) and prepared off the main actor; session lists coalesce for 25 ms; chat scroll values go to unobserved `ChatScratch`.

**P6: list identity**

- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ComposerParts.swift:168`: the composer's attached images use `id: \.offset`; removing one shifts every later row's identity.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/MessageViews.swift:1037`: a message's Markdown chunks, and its images (`apple/Persona/Views/Chat/MessageViews.swift:332`, `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/MessageViews.swift:401`), use `id: \.offset`.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkCard.swift:305-335`, `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkMessageContent.swift:176-198`: Lark cards and messages are trees of `AnyView` inside chat rows (37 of the 69 `AnyView(` uses).
- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/ConnectorThread/GitHubThreadView.swift:387`: re-parses a hunk's lines on every `body` and identifies them by offset.
- Counts: 131 `ForEach(Array(….enumerated()), id: \.offset)`, 145 `id: \.self`; most are over small constant arrays, which is fine.

**P8: images**

- `apple/Persona/Persona/PersonaStore.swift:566`: avatar decode and `preparingForDisplay()` on the main actor, from `body` (`apple/Persona/Persona/PersonaViews.swift:19`); `isOnPhone` checks the file system before the cache on every call.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkAttachmentView.swift:33`: `UIImage(data:)` of the thumbnail in `body`, every render.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Session/CompareView.swift:249`: decodes both full images of a comparison from `body`, every render.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/PhotoAttach.swift:35`: picked photos are decoded at full size, scaled and encoded to JPEG on the main actor (`MessagePhotos`); `apple/Persona/Views/Assistant/AssistantView.swift:1036-1042` does the same.
- `apple/PersonaWatch/WatchPetView.swift:169`: `UIImage(contentsOfFile:)` in a watch row's `body`.
- Good: `apple/Persona/Views/Inbox/Lark/LarkMedia.swift:110`, `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatImageLoader.swift:34`, `apple/Persona/Views/Settings/AvatarUploadModel.swift:82`.

**P9: timers, loops and animations**

- `apple/Packages/BeautifulUI/Sources/BeautifulUI/Components/PromptBar.swift:811`: `TimelineView(.animation)` at 30 fps with no `paused:`.
- `apple/PersonaWatch/PersonaWatchApp.swift:285-288`: an endless 8 s poll started in `init` from an unstructured `Task`; `try? await Task.sleep` swallows cancellation, so a cancelled task would spin.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift:669-675`: wakes the main actor every 500 ms while a dev chat is open to see whether the chrome has been idle; a single rescheduled deadline would do.
- `apple/Persona/Views/Chat/ChatPin.swift:203-206`: an 8 ms main-actor sleep loop as a hand-made display link while a pinned row rises (bounded; `CADisplayLink` would follow the screen's refresh).

**P10: before the first frame**

- `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:2107`, `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:3069`, `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:3073` and `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:3078`: the drafts, quotes and comments files are each read and decoded twice while `AppModel` initializes (six synchronous loads).
- `apple/Persona/Persona/PersonaStore.swift:157` and `apple/Persona/Persona/PersonaStore.swift:169`: persona index files read and decoded in `init`, from `AppModel.init` (`apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:328`).
- `apple/Persona/App/AppModel.swift:2834`: the cached snapshot (all machines, sessions and interactions) decodes on the main actor before the first frame. That is by design (it is what the first frame shows); its time grows with the number of sessions and needs a launch measurement.
- The app delegate's launch callback is light (`apple/Persona/App/PersonaApp.swift:115-125`).

**Instrumentation that exists**

`PerfTrace` / `PerfCount` (`apple/Persona/App/PerfSignpost.swift`), `MainThreadWatchdog`, `FrameStats`, `apple/Mac/App/MacPerfHarness.swift`, `apple/PersonaUITests/PerfTestCase.swift` (`XCTHitchMetric`, scroll and navigation signpost metrics, `XCTClockMetric`), `RenderBudgetTests`. No `OSSignposter` intervals, no MetricKit.
