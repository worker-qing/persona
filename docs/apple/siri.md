# Deeper Siri integration (Ask Persona, personal Agents, Control Center)

Building on `docs/apple/intents.md` (Ask Claude / status / approve first / open session), this adds Siri entry points for the assistant and personal Agents. Every intent connects directly to the hub in the background:
it reads `Keychain.serverConfig` afresh each time (the hub address + device token saved during pairing). The App does not need to be in the foreground, and no WebSocket is required.

## Intents

| Intent | Title | Purpose | Run mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AskPersonaIntent` | Ask Persona | Sends a question to the assistant's main chat (`main` from `GET /api/v1/assistant`; if none exists, opens one with `POST /api/v1/assistant/conversations` and `main:true`). Polls `items?after_seq=` for up to about 24 seconds, waits until the session is no longer working, then reads the assistant's text aloud and displays a card (question + full answer). If the answer is slow, says "Sent to Persona. It's still thinking." | Background |
| `TalkToPersonaIntent` | Talk to Persona | Starts a duplex voice chat when CarPlay is connected (`docs/apple/carplay.md`). Otherwise asks the user to connect CarPlay first and does not start. | Background |
| `AgentTaskIntent` | Give an Agent a Task | `POST /api/v1/agents/sessions/{id}/messages`, with a new UUID for `clientId` each time (hub deduplication + outbox). Choose a session through `PersonalAgentEntity`; if none is selected, use the first in the list with `canSend`. Like the Personal Agents page and its Spotlight index, it uses the App's currently selected hub group (`hub.group`; the first group if it is missing). | Background |
| `AgentsStatusIntent` | Personal Agent Unread | `GET /api/v1/agents/sessions`: reports how many sessions have how many unread messages, listing the first three; if none are unread, reports the three most recent. Reads the App's currently selected hub group, as the Personal Agents page does. | Background |
| `AddTodoIntent` | New To-Do | `POST /api/v1/todos` (`{"title", "notes"?}`, see `docs/assistant/todos.md`), in the App's currently selected hub group (`hub.group`, the same as the To-dos page; falls back to the first group if it is missing). Reads "To-do saved: '…'" and returns the title for use in subsequent Shortcuts actions. If an old hub lacks the to-do endpoint (404), asks the user to update the hub first. | Background |
| `OpenPersonalAgentIntent` | Open Personal Agent | Tapping a personal Agent session in Spotlight opens that conversation directly (Agents › Personal Agents › session; back goes to the personal Agents list; an open settings sheet is closed first). `AppModel.openPersonalAgent` is handed to `ChatsView`, which, as with `openChat`, pushes it once the list has appeared and the navigation stack is still. | Foreground |
| `OpenPersonaAssistantIntent` / `OpenPersonaAgentsIntent` | Open Persona Assistant / Agents | Intents behind the controls for Control Center, the Lock Screen, and the Action Button. | Foreground |
| `StartMeetingRecordingIntent` | Record a Meeting | Starts a meeting recording on the phone, named after the calendar event happening now, with its Live Activity (Stop, Bookmark); does nothing while something already records. An `AudioRecordingIntent`: no hub needed, the transcript syncs later (`docs/apple/recording.md`, "Meeting recordings"). | Background (foreground once, to ask for the microphone) |

`PersonalAgentEntity` is an `IndexedEntity`: whenever the Agents page finishes loading, it calls `CSSearchableIndex.default().indexAppEntities(...)`
and `PersonaShortcuts.updateAppShortcutParameters()`, so Spotlight can find sessions and Siri phrases containing session names can match them.

## Phrases (`PersonaShortcuts`, available immediately after installation, no manual setup)

- Ask Persona: "问 Persona" (Ask Persona), "用 Persona 问一下" (Ask with Persona), "Ask Persona", "Ask Persona a question" → Siri then asks "What do you want to ask Persona?"
- Give an Agent a Task: "用 Persona 让 Agent 去做" (Have Persona give an Agent a task), "让 Persona 的 <会话名> 去做" (Have Persona's <session name> do it), "Persona 交给 Agent" (Persona, hand it to an Agent), "Have Persona agent do something", "Send a task to <session name> with Persona"
- Personal Agent Unread: "Persona 个人 Agent 未读" (Persona personal Agent unread), "Persona Agent 有什么新消息" (What's new from Persona Agents), "Check Persona agents"
- New To-Do: "用 Persona 新建待办" (Create a to-do with Persona), "Persona 记个待办" (Persona, note a to-do), "Persona 加个待办" (Persona, add a to-do), "Add a to-do in Persona", "New Persona to-do" → Siri then asks "What's the to-do?"; notes can only be entered in the Shortcuts App.
- Record a Meeting: "用 Persona 录会议" (Record a meeting with Persona), "用 Persona 录下这个会" (Record this meeting with Persona), "在 Persona 开始会议录音" (Start a meeting recording in Persona), "Persona 录会议" (Persona, record the meeting). The tenth App Shortcut: Apple allows ten, so the list is full.
- The existing Ask Claude / status actions each gain an English phrase.

`String` parameters cannot appear in phrases (see `docs/apple/intents.md`), so Siri asks for the question / task contents after the invocation phrase.

## Action Button and Control Center

- Action Button: **Settings › Action Button › Shortcut**; select "Ask Persona", "Give an Agent a Task", "New To-Do" or "Record a Meeting" directly (App Shortcuts appear automatically), or **Controls** › Record a Meeting.
- Control Center / Lock Screen: the `PersonaWidgets` extension adds `ControlWidget`s: `AskPersonaControl`, `PersonaAgentsControl` open the App's assistant page / Agents page;
  `MeetingRecordingControl` (kind `persona.control.meeting-recording`) starts a meeting recording without opening the App.
  Their intents live in `LiveActivity/PersonaControlIntents.swift` and `LiveActivity/RecordingIntents.swift` (compiled into both App and extension; `perform` runs only in the App).

## Not implemented / deferred

- Apple Intelligence assistant schemas such as `@AppIntent(schema: .assistant...)`: none fits "ask a private assistant" (existing schemas cover domains such as mail / photos / books), so they are not integrated.
- A personal Agent's Spotlight result carries no hub group: with several hub groups connected, the opened conversation uses the App's selected group, and a session in another group shows an error on its page.
- Ask Persona has a 24-second answer limit: long tasks cannot be read in full; view them in the App's main chat.
- For long chats in the car, see `docs/apple/carplay.md` (Siri is only the entry point; the chat uses duplex voice).
- Controls other than Record a Meeting can only open the App. Asking directly from a control would require App Intents text input, which controls do not support.

## Verification on a phone

1. After installing through TestFlight / Xcode, open the App once (and pair it), then visit **Agents › Personal Agents** once so sessions are indexed.
2. Say "Ask Persona" to Siri, then ask a question: it should read the answer and show the full text on a card; the App's main chat should contain this turn.
3. Say "Have Persona agent do something", choose a session, and describe the task: it should reply "Sent to '…'"; that session in the Lark gateway should receive the message. The same task must not be duplicated (clientId).
4. Say "Check Persona agents".
5. Say "Add a to-do in Persona", then give a title: it should reply "To-do saved: '…'", and the App's To-dos page should contain the new entry.
6. These actions should appear under **Shortcuts App › Persona** and be selectable for the Action Button; **Control Center › Add a Control › Persona** should contain two controls.
7. Searching for a personal Agent's session name in Spotlight should find it; tapping it opens that conversation directly, and back in the top-left returns to the personal Agents list. Try once each with the settings sheet open, with the App in the background, and with it not running.

Unit tests: `PersonaTests/SiriIntentsTests.swift` (answer extraction, polling completion, spoken text, session selection, unread text), `PersonaTests/IntentsTests.swift` (new to-do text, old hubs, the hub group read).
After compilation, `Persona.app/Metadata.appintents/extract.actionsdata` should contain the new actions and autoShortcuts.
