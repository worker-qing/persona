# Working with other people and Agents: claim the issue before you start

Several people work in this repository, each alongside their own Agents. Two people have fixed the same bug, and someone has found halfway through a fix that it was already fixed. So:
**claim the issue before you start, and every PR must link an issue**. The overall flow (branching, English PRs, merging after local verification passes) is in `CLAUDE.md` ("Development workflow"); this page has the claiming details, comment templates and commands you can copy.

## Rules

1. **Check for duplicates before starting**: search for an open issue and open PR about the same thing, and glance at recently closed issues and merged PRs (don't redo finished work).
2. **Someone has claimed it and the claim hasn't expired**: don't work on it. You can add information, repro steps, logs or leads under the issue (start the comment with "Note:"). The same goes when there is already an open PR: add to the PR / issue.
3. **No issue? Create one**. When you start, post a claim comment on the issue: what you're doing, how you plan to change it, how long you expect it to take. If an Agent is doing the work, say so.
   If the work touches UI, settings or defaults, or how something is counted, the claim also has an `Acceptance:` line: criteria written against `docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md`, naming the principles involved and the evidence that will show each is met (screenshots, tests, commands).
4. **24 hours with no update counts as abandoned**: someone else can post a comment taking it over (with the reason). If you're still working on it, post a progress comment to renew.
5. **Every PR must link an issue**: write `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` / `Refs #N` in the description. PRs with no linked issue get a comment from the explicitly dispatched metadata Action and are closed by it.
6. **Old issue numbers**: `#N` in lines written up to 2026-11-07 (check `git blame`) refers to the previous tracker. Here the same numbers belong to unrelated issues, and issues carried over from it have new numbers. Leave those references as they are; new text cites current numbers.

Don't use GitHub's assign (many people don't have triage permission, and it isn't needed), don't use commands like `/claim`, and expiry isn't handled automatically: the comments in the issue are the only source of truth.

## Who is working on it: the comment and its GitHub account decide

- **The owner is the GitHub account that wrote the comment**. An Agent posts comments with the gh account of the person it belongs to (no separate bot account), and that person is responsible for the Agent's claim; the comment body doesn't need a name.
- When an Agent is doing the work, the claim comment gets an extra line `Agent: yes (<machine id> / <branch or session>)`: several Agents of the same person share one account and are told apart by this line.
  Use the machine id given to the machine in the config, not its hostname.
- **Only what's written in the issue counts**: mentioning it in a group chat, agreeing in a DM, the issue's assignee or labels are not claims.
- Comments are classified by the prefix on their first line, so people and Agents can filter: `Claim:`, `Progress:`, `Take over:`, `Abandon:`, `Note:`.

### What counts as a valid claim

- The current owner is the author of the latest "Claim:" or "Take over:" comment, provided that account hasn't posted "Abandon:" since.
- **Update**: any new comment by the owner on this issue, or a new push or comment on a linked PR (a PR whose description has `Fixes` / `Closes` / `Refs` for this issue).
- The claim is valid for 24 hours from the owner's **last update**; after 24 hours with no update, it counts as abandoned.
- Two people claim at almost the same time: the earlier one wins. After posting your claim, read the comments again; if yours wasn't first, delete it (`gh issue comment <number> --delete-last --yes`) and do something else.

## Comment templates

Claim (Agents copy it as is; if a person is doing it, drop the "Agent" line):

```text
Claim: <what you're doing, one sentence>
Plan: <how you'll change it, which places>
ETA: <how long, e.g. "2 hours", "today">
Acceptance: <only for UI, settings / defaults or counts: which principles in docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md, and the evidence for each>
Agent: yes (<machine id> / <branch or session>)
```

Renew (still working; at least one within 24 hours; a push to a linked PR also counts as an update):

```text
Progress: <how far you've got, next step, new ETA>
```

Take over (the original owner has had no update for more than 24 hours):

```text
Take over: claimed <time>, last update <time>, more than 24 hours ago
Plan: <how you'll change it; if the original branch / PR has usable progress, say you'll continue from it>
ETA: <how long>
Agent: yes (<machine id> / <branch or session>)
```

Abandon (you can't finish or are switching to something else; say so, so others don't wait 24 hours):

```text
Abandon: <how far you got, what's left, where the branch / PR is>
```

Note (someone else has claimed it and you have information for the owner):

```text
Note: <repro steps, logs, leads, relevant code locations>
```

## Commands (Agents can copy these directly)

Run them in the repository directory; `gh` uses the current repository automatically, and gh fills in `{owner}/{repo}` in `gh api` paths. All times are UTC.

### 1. Check for duplicates

```sh
# Open issues / open PRs about the same thing (searches titles, bodies and comments)
gh issue list --state open --search "<keywords>"
gh pr list --state open --search "<keywords>"
# Search issues and PRs at once
gh search issues "<keywords>" --repo "$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)" --state open --include-prs
# Recently closed issues, merged PRs, commits on main: don't redo finished work
gh issue list --state closed --search "<keywords>" --limit 10
gh pr list --state merged --search "<keywords>" --limit 10
git fetch origin && git log origin/main --oneline -i --grep "<keywords>" | head
```

If you find an issue that means the same thing (whoever created it, however the title is worded), claim it there instead of creating another; if someone else has claimed it, follow the "Take over" rules. Create a new one only if there really is none.

### 2. Check whether an issue is claimed and whether the claim has expired

```sh
gh issue view <number> --comments
# Only Claim / Progress / Take over / Abandon (time, account, first line)
gh issue view <number> --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | test("^(Claim|Progress|Take over|Abandon):")) | "\(.createdAt)  \(.author.login)  \(.body | split("\n")[0])"'
# PRs linked to this issue and when they were last updated
gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<number>/timeline' --paginate --jq '.[] | select(.event == "cross-referenced" and .source.issue.pull_request != null) | .source.issue | "#\(.number)  \(.state)  \(.updated_at)  \(.user.login)  \(.title)"'
```

If the author of the latest "Claim:" / "Take over:" hasn't posted "Abandon:" since, and the owner's last comment or the linked PR's last update is within 24 hours: don't work on it; add a note instead.

### 3. Create an issue

```sh
gh issue create --title "<one sentence saying what to do>" --label bug --body-file - <<'EOF'
## Symptom / requirement
<what it is, why>

## Repro
<steps, logs>
EOF
```

Requirements get `enhancement`, fixes get `bug`, docs get `documentation`. The command prints the issue link at the end; the trailing number is the issue number.

When creating an issue on the web, choose the `Bug report` or `Feature request` form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`) to add the `bug` / `enhancement` label automatically. Field names and issue bodies are in English. You can also use a blank issue or the command above.

#### TestFlight feedback

Issues created from TestFlight feedback (crash reports in App Store Connect, testers' text / screenshot feedback) must be filterable by source:

- **Always add the `testflight` label** (together with `bug` / `enhancement`); if you don't have permission to add labels, prefix the title with `[TestFlight]`, and someone with permission adds the label when they see it.
- **Check for duplicates first**: one issue per piece of feedback. End the body with the dedup marker `<!-- testflight-intake:<sha256(feedback submission id)> -->`,
  and before creating, check with `gh search issues --repo <owner/repo> "testflight-intake:<hash>"` whether it already exists; if an issue for the same crash cause exists, add a "Note:" on it.
- **Redact**: include only the technical summary, a symbol-only call stack (addresses removed), App version, OS version and device model. Leave out the tester's email and identity,
  crash / install / device identifiers of any kind, Bundle ID, memory addresses and image UUIDs, container and personal paths, network / battery / storage, language and time zone, exact times,
  the specific build number and raw attachments; raw logs stay only in a 0600 file on your machine. End the body with a "Privacy handling" section saying what was removed.
  Examples: #752, #1144.

```sh
gh issue create --label bug --label testflight --title "<one sentence describing the symptom>" --body-file <redacted body>
```

### 4. Claim, renew, take over, abandon

```sh
gh issue comment <number> --body-file - <<'EOF'
Claim: <what you're doing>
Plan: <how you'll change it>
ETA: <how long>
Acceptance: <only for UI, settings / defaults or counts: principles from docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md and their evidence>
Agent: yes (<machine id> / <branch or session>)
EOF

# Read again after posting to confirm the earliest valid claim is yours (if not, delete yours with --delete-last --yes)
gh issue view <number> --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | test("^(Claim|Take over|Abandon):")) | "\(.createdAt)  \(.author.login)  \(.body | split("\n")[0])"'

gh issue comment <number> --body "Progress: <how far you've got, next step, new ETA>"
gh issue comment <number> --body "Abandon: <how far you got, what's left, where the branch / PR is>"
```

Take over uses the template above, also posted with `--body-file -`.

### 5. Link the issue when opening a PR

```sh
# Check once more before opening: the issue's comments, and whether someone already fixed it on main
gh issue view <number> --comments
git fetch origin && git merge origin/main   # prefer merge to rebase, see below

gh pr create --title "fix(ios): <English title>" --body-file - <<'EOF'
<English: what changed and why>

Fixes #<number>
EOF
```

`gh pr create --body-file` skips `.github/pull_request_template.md`; copy its sections (including the design principles self-check when the change touches UI, settings / defaults or counts) into the body yourself.

- Updating a PR branch with `main`: prefer `git merge origin/main` on the branch to a rebase. PRs are squash-merged, so the merge commit never reaches `main`;
  conflicts are resolved once instead of once per commit, and the push is a plain push with no force while other Agents work in the repository (#5988).
  In a merge "ours" is your branch and "theirs" is `main`, the reverse of a rebase: mind it with `git checkout --ours/--theirs` and `scripts/i18n/apple_l10n.py merge`.
  A rebase is still allowed, for example for a single-commit branch.
- Merging: once the PR's relevant local verification passes, `scripts/hooks/merge-pr.sh <number>`, not `gh pr merge` directly. It first scans the PR's changed files, commit messages, title and body with this machine's private values, and only squash-merges and deletes the branch if that passes (`docs/operations/testing.md`, "Privacy scan"). PRs do not automatically start hosted CI.
- `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N`: GitHub closes the issue automatically after merging. `Refs #N`: links without closing (an issue split into several PRs, or only partly fixed).
- PR titles and bodies are in English (after a squash merge they are the commit on `main`); issues and comments are also in English.

## Checking PRs with no linked issue

`.github/workflows/pr-needs-issue.yml` runs only when an operator explicitly dispatches it from the default branch with `pr_number=<number>`; opening, editing or reopening a PR starts no workflow:

- **Counts as linked** (case-insensitive): `fix` / `fixes` / `fixed` / `close` / `closes` / `closed` / `resolve` / `resolves` / `resolved` / `ref` / `refs`
  followed by `#number` (a colon after the keyword is allowed, e.g. `Fixes: #12`), or `owner/repo#number` for this repository; or a link to an issue in this repository (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>`).
- **Doesn't count**: anything inside code blocks, inline code or HTML comments (the examples in the PR template); a bare `#12` with no keyword; issues in other repositories; PR links; links written only in the title,
  or linked by hand only in the "Development" sidebar of the PR page.
- No link: it leaves a comment explaining the rule, then closes the PR. **Once the author edits the description to add a link, the PR is reopened automatically** and the comment changes to "Reopened";
  if automatic reopening fails (for example the branch was deleted), it posts another comment, and after adding the link you reopen it by hand (`gh pr reopen <PR number>`).
- It only reopens PRs the Action itself closed; a PR closed by a person is not reopened even after adding a link. Editing an already closed PR that still has no link doesn't produce a duplicate comment.
- PRs from bot accounts (dependabot and the like) are exempt.
- Editing the description: `gh pr edit <PR number> --body-file <file>`, or edit it on the web.

### Maintenance

- Logic and flow tests: `node scripts/test/pr_needs_issue_test.mjs` (extracts the github-script script from the workflow and runs dozens of description samples and the close / reopen flow against a fake GitHub client);
  after changing it, also run `actionlint .github/workflows/pr-needs-issue.yml`.
- It uses a manually supplied PR number and the default branch's workflow with a token that has write permission, so it **never checks out or runs the PR's code**;
  the PR's title and description are read only as data via the API and never put into `${{ }}` (that would inject them into the script). Permissions are limited to `pull-requests: write` and `issues: write`.
- Also because it runs the default branch's version, a PR that changes this workflow doesn't use the new logic itself; it takes effect only after merging. Before merging, rely on the tests above.
