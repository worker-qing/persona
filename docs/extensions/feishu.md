# Lark's role in Persona

> **Since 2026-11-04 (#1520, plugin step 3c)**: the entire Lark-gateway path (app `/api/v1/lark/…`, Inbox / knowledge source, Moments, assistant ol gate / credentials, `/agent`, personal Agent) moved out of open-source repository into Lark extension (`docs/extensions/extensions.md`, `docs/plans/plan-extensions.md` “Step 3”).
> Extension preserves behavior below; referenced `hub/lark*.go` / `internal/lark` sources removed. Open-source keeps official `lark-cli`, Lark bot, Lark mail.

**Persona is not a second Lark.** It gathers life / work information for AI processing; Lark is one source.
(User correction 2026-10-27: previous Lark-like Workbench—search, cloud docs, calendar, meetings, Minutes, tasks, approvals, OKR, contacts, Moments feed, mail, favorites, topics, chat info, Today—entirely deleted.) Do not restore those pages.

**Explicit #392 exception**: off-by-default Show Messages on Home in Lark settings adds Messages for browsing all direct / group chats. Shared accounts / chat pages / outbox / sync with Inbox, no second implementation; other Lark pages stay out. [Lark capability consolidation](lark-migration.md).

Three optional hub integrations: Lark gateway (third-party user-authenticated web client through private extension), official `lark-cli` (`docs/plans/plan-lark-cli.md`), and a private Lark Agent extension. This document covers gateway; its deployment / variables / commands in extension instructions.

## What stays

| Capability | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Messages | Inbox (`docs/assistant/inbox.md`), optional Messages | Unread / mentions / direct chats mixed with mail, event-grouped / AI-sorted; opens `LarkChatView` |
| Document links | `FeishuDocReader` (`Views/Feishu/Docs/`) | Native in-app rendering from any link, `LinkSheet` / message. With `lark_doc_comments`, comments reply threads / whole doc, resolve / reopen, mention people (#1290, `FeishuDocsComments.swift`; web `docs/web/web.md` “Links open inside the page” (**Lark doc comments**), `docs/protocol/protocol.md` Lark APIs) |
| Moments links | `LarkMomentsCard` / `LarkMomentsPostView` | Shared-post preview opens one post / comments; no browsable feed |
| User-related Moments | Inbox via extension, formerly hub inbox_moments.go; knowledge | Comments on own post, replies / mentions: one event per post, AI sorting / comment drafts, Send posts comment back (`docs/assistant/inbox.md` “Moments”) |
| Other links | `LinkSheet` WebView | Minutes / events / tasks / approvals in in-app web cards |
| AI Lark tools | Hub, `server/internal/lark` / assistant `lark_api` | Read-only search / read messages, docs, Moments, calendar, Minutes as context |
| Persona in Lark | Bot (`docs/extensions/bots.md`) | DM self-built bot = main chat; extra Persona entry, not copied Lark feature |

`FeishuLinks.route(_:)` routes docs→`.doc`, Moments `…/client/moments/detail?postId=`→`.momentsPost`, others nil→web. `FeishuRoute` only chat / doc / profile / momentsPost, destinations from individual messages / links.

## Data paths

- `GET /api/v1/lark/raw/<path>` = gateway `GET /agent/v1/<path>`, read-only; JSON `/api/...` media rewritten to hub. POST only `search/page` / `search/mention-history` (large-body read search). Assistant `lark_*` MCP same `lark.Read` allowlist.
- **Assistant calls gateway itself** (2026-10-30), gateway skill from extension since #1571, no repo copy. Commands directly call agent API for reads / writes; node gate confirms externally visible writes on phone. `docs/assistant/assistant.md` “Lark: skill supplied by the Lark extension”. Quick reference below supplements local tests; gateway skill references more complete and authoritative.
- Chats / messages / read / send / reactions / card buttons use dedicated hub routes (`docs/protocol/protocol.md` Lark APIs).
- **Without gateway, official `lark-cli`** (`docs/plans/plan-lark-cli.md`,#273): assistant integration and the L2 read-only `larkcli` connector are available, with `lark.cli` in the manager's manager.json, assistant PATH, and the same write gate (`docs/assistant/assistant.md` “Lark: `lark-cli`”). Inbox / knowledge / `/agent` / app Lark pages still gateway-only; add L3–L6 progressively.

## Gateway and hub on separate computers

Gateway Agent API remains source-loopback-only. If source can reach hub, dedicated SSH user reverse-tunnels hub loopback port to source Agent API. Source user systemd service `Restart=always`, `ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`, SSH keepalive, linger, independent of developer machine. Pin hub SSH host key.

Hub tunnel user public-key / remote-forwarding only: `GatewayPorts no`, PermitListen 127.0.0.1:<tunnel port>, `PermitOpen none`, `MaxSessions 0`; disable TTY / agent / X11 / Unix forwarding. Key restrict,port-forwarding,permitlisten="127.0.0.1:<tunnel port>", ssh -N -T. Check `sshd -t` / `sshd -T -C` user=<tunnel user>,host=localhost,addr=127.0.0.1 before reload, preserve admin account.

The manager's `manager.json` lark.base_url=http://127.0.0.1:<tunnel port>/agent/v1, `lark.token`,0600. Transfer token securely from source env, never print / commit, backup config. Verify loopback listener, unauth health 401, authorized health / chat reads, `/events` WS, repeat after restart. No sending / read-state changes required.

Same-machine Docker gateway / hub may use configured `lark.container`, no default, reading agent token from container env rather than config; recreated-token 401 rereads. Now extension owns this, see instructions.

Distinguish two 401 types (2026-10-31): gateway lost Lark login returns `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` / `AUTH_*`, valid agent token. Old hub discarded configured token on every 401 then inspected default Docker container, breaking all requests / live events until personad restart. Now `AUTH_*` gives Gateway Not Signed In to Lark (API 502 `lark_not_logged_in`, logs / Inbox / app; extension logic). Never discard configured token. Event reconnect backoff max 1 minute, same error logged once, auto-recovers on user login.

## Multiple accounts

Gateway x-multi-account `GET /agent/v1/accounts`; choose account via gateway header / ol_account. Account number is accounts.id, not Lark user ID; added-account resource URLs include ol_account. Persona reads all (#1321, previously `lark.account` only):

- **Default account**: `/api/v1/lark/*` requests without `ol_account` use the default account from the extension's own Lark-gateway configuration. Hub does not pass `manager.json`'s `lark.account` to the extension. The Inbox also follows the extension's default: the manager reads `default` from `GET accounts` on the extension messaging source `lark`. If unavailable, it uses the last successful value; only if none was ever obtained does it fall back to `lark.account`, or primary account 1 when omitted (#5098). Old Android / web clients without `ol_account` still see only the default account. Assistant `lark_*` tools / `ol`, knowledge, `/agent`, personal-Agent settings, and document reading also use it; `lark_messages` can pass `account` to read other accounts, and the extension documents account selection for its commands.
- **Per-request**: all Lark APIs accept `ol_account`=<number>, extension-provided, formerly lark_accounts.go per-account clients. Invalid 400, nonexistent gateway rejection, never default fallback. Preserve media ol_account. Raw proxy forwards query, not client account header; never query in base_url.
- **Account list** `GET /api/v1/lark/accounts` fetches at most once/minute, selecting logged-in nonquarantined Inbox / events accounts. Old gateway without accounts treated default-only.
- **Events**: default connection, others reconciled every 2 minutes. App lark events carry account, nondefault `ol_account` for cache targeting. `/agent`, personal Agent, knowledge only default events.
- **Inbox**: sequential each signed-in account unread / mentions. Default errors fail round; other errors log only. `lark.account_id`, old 0=1; `lark.ol_account` for nondefault app open / reply. Same group in two accounts distinct events. Multiple sources “Lark · <name>”; reply as item's account. Never change Lark read state.
- **iOS**: `APIClient.lark(_:)` adds `ol_account`; `LarkConversation.account` follows chat / topics / profiles / cards / mentions / previews. Cache / listeners keyed `LarkConversation.key` a<number>-<feed>. Multiple-account Messages capsules with unread counts, independent lists / pins; subtitle Lark · <name>. Settings › Connectors › Lark lists all.
- **Web**: `web/src/lib/lark-accounts.ts` list / browser selection / `larkPath` query. `LarkChatRef.account` follows reads / read reports / sends / replies / topics / pins, accepts same-account pushes only. Messages account buttons below search, lists `larkChatsFor`, heading Group Chat · <name>. Inbox uses `lark.ol_account`; settings lists accounts. E2E `scripts/test/web_lark_accounts_e2e.py`, MOCK_LARK_ACCOUNTS=1. Android no switch, default only.

## API quick reference (tested on hub; assistant uses extension skill, gateway references authoritative)

### Search
- `search/page` POST body `{tab,query,cursor,limit,senderIds,chatIds,feedId,startTime,endTime,attachmentTypes,chatType,docTypes,ownerIds,sortType}` → `{items,nextCursor,total}`. Tabs from `search/tabs`: messages / cloud docs / apps / contacts / groups / mail / help desk / events. Query nonempty or 400; Unix seconds; `nextCursor` several-KB token.
- Quick search: `search?q=` messages, `search/people?q=`, `search/documents?q=`, `calendar/search?q=`, `mail/search?q=`, `minutes/search?q=`, `todos/search?q=` with token pagination; search/in-chat?feedId=&q=.
- Highlights UTF-16 offsets; negative message position means topic reply: `GET messages/:id` for `threadId` before navigation.
- Event hit ID <eventId>:<instance start>; `calendar/event/:id` only prefix before colon.

### Documents
- `documents/read?url=&format=markdown`;403 `DOCUMENT_EXPORT_FORBIDDEN` /422 `DOCUMENT_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED` → `format=json` ProseMirror tree. Base / files / boards Open in Lark. Also `documents/header`, `documents/reader/info`, `documents/ai-summary` (read-only cache), `documents/comments`.
- Markdown export fixed start # Title + `[Source](<url>)`; images absolute gateway URLs rewritten to `/api/v1/lark/raw/documents/…`.
- Each list item separate `bulletList` / `orderedList`, continue numbering across siblings. Table colwidth pixels; implement rowspan placeholders. `FeishuDocRenderer.swift` / PersonaTests/FeishuDocsTests.swift.
- `authority.copy=false` disables selection.

### Calendar / meetings / Minutes
- `calendar/week?start&end` UTC …Z; `+08:00` gives 400. `calendar/event/:id` recurring uses sourceId.
- `meetings?count&cursor`, `meetings/:historyId`, `meetings/:historyId/insights` AI notes.
- `minutes?scope=all&cursor`, `minutes/:token`, `/transcript` `/summary-items` `/media`, hub Range forwarding for streaming.

### Tasks / approvals / OKR
- `todos?count` no cursor max 200; `todos/completed`, `todos/:guid/detail` lacks title, lookup list; task-lists. All-day due date UTC midnight.
- `approvals?tab=todo|done|initiated|ccUnread|ccRead&cursor&q`, `approvals/detail?instanceId`; external-system 502 APPROVAL_DETAIL_UNREADABLE.
- `okr/people`, `okr/owners/:ownerId/periods`, okr/:okrId.

### People / Moments / Lark mail
- `users/:id` profile, `contacts/org`, `contacts/departments/:id`, search/people?q=.
- `moments/posts/:id`, `/comments` dedicated hub route, `moments/feed?tabId=`, moments/notifications.
- `mail/threads?label=INBOX&cursor…`, required label; mail/messages/:id(/html). Base64 ID encoded exactly once in path, %2F.

### Chats
- `conversations/:feedId/settings` announcement, `/pins` `/resources?kind=docs|files|media` `/todos` `/members`; favorites; threads/feed.
- List pitfalls `docs/lessons/lark-mail.md`: unreliable `isDone`, `onTopRankAt` pins, unknown scope treated as inbox.

<a id="话题分页限制h06"></a>

### Topic pagination limit (H06)

Topic replies (`GET /agent/v1/messages/:messageId/thread`) page only backward: the gateway returns the latest page or the one before `beforePosition`, never a newer page (source review: `docs/archive/extensions/feishu-records.md`).

Hub topic route therefore has no after yet. Ordinary messages support `afterPosition`, but topic replies use independent `threadPosition`; cannot borrow ordinary cursor or append latest page as continuous. Android ↓ Latest Replies reloads / replaces current window; older pagination / post-reply refresh unchanged. Add newer pagination once upstream fetch / query / cursor contract exists. No real Lark / live hub accessed; conclusions from source review.
