# To-do status SOP

How the To-dos page decides where each to-do shows (#3156). The page's default list is by **status section**; the older
grouping by folder stays available as a secondary view (List › Status | Folder). The code follows this document:
`web/src/lib/todo-triage.ts` (`triage`, `triageTodos`), with tests in `web/src/lib/todo-triage.test.ts`, and its
native copies (see "Clients"). A change to the rules changes all of them in the same PR.

## Principle: real signals only

A to-do's section comes from what the hub and the computers report, never from what an agent says about its own
work. An agent writing "done" in its reply does not finish anything; its turn ending, a review, a merge or a deploy does.

| Signal | Where it comes from | Values used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Agent alive and running | The linked, not released agents' sessions (herdr and other engines, via the hub's session list) | asking (`needs_you`), cut off by a model error (`turn_error`), working or starting, finished unseen (`unread`), idle, gone |
| PR / delivery | `delivery.state` and `pr_url` on the to-do (`docs/assistant/todos.md`, "Delivery") | none, PR open (`pr`, or a `pr_url` with no delivery past it), merged not deployed (`merged`, `off`), deployed (`live`) |
| Review verdict | The latest `task_review` in the to-do's supervision (`docs/assistant/unified-entry.md`) | `accepted`, `rework`, `needs_user`, `cancelled`, pending review |
| Ask | The to-do's `ask` (`docs/assistant/todos.md`, "Waiting for the owner") | a decision, "cannot be done", "done", "please verify" |
| Last activity | The latest of: the to-do's created, updated, reopened and done times; its supervision's update, last report and last review; its delivery and ask times; each linked agent's session update; a restore from Shelved | a moment |

## Sections

| Section | Shown | What it holds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Waiting on you | open | Something only the owner can move: an answer, an approval, a decision, a retry |
| Working | open | An agent is running on it now |
| Just finished | open | Worth a look: closed, accepted or deployed in the last 24 hours, or a turn nobody has seen / a review not done yet (those stay until seen or reviewed) |
| PR to merge | open | Its work stopped at a pull request that is still open and nothing runs: however old, it stays here, with the PR link and how long since it moved |
| Other open | folded | Open, recently active, none of the above (an agent stopped and seen, a reminder of the user's own) |
| Shelved | folded | No activity for 48 hours and nothing running (see "Shelving") |
| Done | folded | Closed, accepted or deployed more than 24 hours ago |

## Decision table

The first rule that holds wins.

| # | Rule | Condition | Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `failed_start` | The task's agent never started (`start_error`) | Waiting on you; Done once 48 hours passed |
| 1a | `superseded` | Rule 1, and its row (see "Related to-dos") has a to-do that really finished: closed without a start error (#3713) | Just finished for 24 hours, then Done; behind that to-do in the row, never leading it |
| 2 | `agent_asks` | An agent waits on the owner (question, approval, plan) or was cut off by a model error | Waiting on you |
| 3 | `owner_decides` | Open, and the review says `needs_user`, or its ask is a decision or "cannot be done" | Waiting on you |
| 4 | `agent_running` | An agent is working or starting | Working |
| 5 | `closed` | `done_at` is set | Just finished for 24 hours, then Done |
| 6 | `accepted` | The latest review accepted it and no review came since, even when the hub reopened it (see "Accepted tasks") | Just finished for 24 hours after the review, then Done |
| 7 | `deployed` | `delivery.state` is `live` | Just finished for 24 hours, then Done |
| 8 | `finished_unseen` | An agent finished a turn nobody has seen, the review is pending, or its ask says done / please verify | Just finished |
| 9 | `pr_open` | Its PR is open (rule "PR / delivery" above); a `pr_url` whose stage is Merge or later is a merged PR, never this (#3205) | PR to merge |
| 10 | `stale` | Shelvable (see "Shelving") and no activity for 48 hours | Shelved |
| 11 | `rest` | Anything else | Other open |

**A failed start whose work got done another way is not the owner's**: the hub closes a to-do whose agent never started
(`done_at` with its `start_error`), and rule 1 keeps it in Waiting on you so the owner can retry or remove it. When the
same piece of work finished in a related to-do (the same plan, PR, issue or title: its row), there is nothing left to
retry: rule 1a files it with that work and it counts as closed, on the page, the sidebar's badge and the assistant's
entries alike (`supersededFailedStarts` in each copy). A failed start that still waits on the owner reads as one on every
client: not ticked or struck through, why it did not start in red, and its checkbox closes it for good (`"done": true`
on it clears `start_error`: the owner closed it; `docs/assistant/todos.md`, API overview).

**Waiting on you is only for what the owner must do in person**: answer a question, grant a permission, decide on a
large feature. A deployed to-do's "Please verify" ask and a "done" conclusion are not: the supervising assistant
checks and accepts them by default, so they sit in Just finished (rule 8), their one-tap button still there for the
owner who wants to accept it themselves.

A merged but not deployed delivery (`merged`, `off`) has no section of its own: the row says where it is held and
who can unhold it, and the to-do falls under rules 10 and 11.

### Deployed needs evidence

"Deployed" means the running hub contains the work: the commit of the hub's `/api/v1/health` (`commit`, else the
`-g<hash>` of `version`) includes the PR's merge commit, which GitHub's compare answers (#3205,
`server/internal/assistant/deploy_check.go`). The hub checks it before it moves a task to the Deploy stage, sets
`delivery.state = live` or asks "Please verify", whether the claim came from the agent's reply ("已部署",
"交付：已上线并实测") or from the completion judge:

- In the running hub: deployed (`live`, stage Deploy), then verified.
- Merged, not in the running hub yet: held at "merged, not deployed" (`delivery.state = merged`, stage Merge, the gate
  "等部署：线上 hub（<commit>）还没包含合并提交 <commit>", who unholds it: other). No "Please verify". A watch looks
  again every minute the hub's commit has changed (GitHub is asked only then); once the deploy lands the task moves
  to `live` and only then is verified.
- The check cannot tell (GitHub or the hub's health unreachable, rate limit): held the same way ("等确认部署"), asked
  again every 10 minutes. A failed check never says deployed.
- Nothing to check against: work that is not a GitHub PR, a PR in a repository the hub is not built from (the hub's
  commit is not in it), or a hub that does not say its commit (a local or Docker build). The agent's word stands,
  logged as unverified.

An open to-do that names a PR and says nothing past it (no delivery, `none` or `pr`; stage before Deploy), whatever
told it, is looked at the same way by that sweep: its PR merged and in the running hub makes it deployed (`live`:
Just finished), merged and not in it "merged, not deployed" with the watch above; an open PR stays a PR to merge. Such a
to-do is asked about again only when the hub's commit changes, or every 10 minutes while its PR is open. It gets no
"Please verify": no turn said it was deployed.

**Without GitHub**: a hub that cannot reach GitHub decides from a file the deploy writes, `deployed-commits.txt`, in
the hub's state directory (or its compatible predecessor) or next to the hub's binary:

```
# persona deployed commits v1
# repo: <owner>/<name>
<full sha> <subject>
```

the deployed commit first, then its ancestors newest first, as `git log --max-count=3000 --format='%H %s' <commit>`
prints them. It is believed only when its first commit is the one the running hub reports, and only for PRs of its
repository. A PR is found by its merge's subject (a squash merge's `… (#N)`, a merge commit's `Merge pull request #N …`):
found, it is deployed, with no network. Not found, GitHub is asked; when GitHub cannot answer (no route, a failure
pauses it for 10 minutes), it is "not in the running hub" (held, "等部署"), and the open to-dos' sweep leaves such a
to-do as it is (its PR may still be open). The file is checked first, GitHub only when the file cannot say.

GitHub is read through the hub's GitHub connector when it is signed in, else with `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the assistant's environment when set, else anonymously (enough
for a public repository; a private one without a token stays held as "cannot tell").

### Deployed work is verified by the supervising assistant

Once deployed (checked as above), a task's "Please verify" is accepted by the supervising assistant by default
(`by_assistant` on the ask, stage Verified, no Lark card): the owner is not asked for each one. Only a big feature, a
to-do with priority `high`, still asks the owner with the card, as before.

## Header count

The header reads "N open · N shelved · N done". **Open** counts to-dos that are not closed, not accepted or deployed,
and not shelved: Waiting on you, Working, PR to merge, Other open, and Just finished rows still open (a finished turn
is not a closed to-do; only a review or the user closes it). **Done** counts closed, accepted and deployed ones. The
sidebar's To-dos badge shows the same open count without quiet tasks (#1731), as before; the page lists and counts them. A task whose agent never started (rule 1) counts as open while it waits on the owner.

Android's list (#3712) shows no such line: each section's title carries its count, the to-dos listed under it (a merged
row's related ones included), so the counts follow a search and the list's filter (#3740).

## Shelving

A to-do is shelvable when it is a task (an agent was ever linked, or a conversation handed it out) and has no due date
ahead. The user's own to-dos without agents (reminders, errands) and ones due later never shelve themselves.

- Shelved to-dos are folded under **Shelved**, not counted as open, and not changed on the hub: nothing is deleted, closed
  or released. Any new activity (an agent working, a report, a review, an edit) takes it out again at once.
- **Restore** on a shelved row counts as activity now: the to-do goes back to its section and shelves again only after
  another 48 hours without a move. The restore is kept in this browser (`localStorage`, `persona.todos.restored`), not
  on the hub; another browser or device still shows it shelved until it moves.

## Related to-dos

To-dos that are the same piece of work share one row, led by its most urgent member (by section, then most recent
activity); "N related" under the row opens the others. Two to-dos are related when they share any key:

- the same PR link (case and a trailing slash ignored);
- the same issue number in the title (`#412`);
- the same title once case, spaces and punctuation are dropped (six characters or more);
- the same plan (`plan_id`: tasks one request was split into).

Relations chain (A shares a PR with B, B an issue with C: one row). A closed to-do never joins an open one's row.

## Accepted tasks

When `task_review` accepts a task, the hub closes it. If its agent is then sent more work, the hub reopens it
(`taskWorking` → `reopenTodo`, `docs/assistant/todos.md`) while the supervision still says `accepted`. Earlier the
page treated every reopened task as not reviewed: it showed "Follow up", its badge "Supervising", and criteria added
with the extra work (`agent_supervise` / `agent_send` replace `done_when`, so the list grew from 5 to 8) as open
with a clock and counted them ("5/8").

The acceptance now stands until a newer review replaces it (`acceptanceStands` in `web/src/lib/supervision.ts`):

- with nothing of it running or asking, the task reads **Accepted** in the row and the detail, and sits in Just finished
  or Done (rule 6);
- with its agent working or asking again, it is in Working or Waiting on you like any task, its badge still Accepted;
- criteria no review judged after the acceptance are marked "not checked" (a dash, not a clock), and the count only
  covers judged ones ("5/5"). The next review, if the supervisor runs one, judges them as usual.

A task the user reopens by hand also keeps the accepted verdict until the next review; the checkbox closes it again.

## Clients

Every client follows this document with its own copy of the rules, each with the same test cases (#3206):

| Client | Rules | Tests | Page |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Web | `web/src/lib/todo-triage.ts` | `web/src/lib/todo-triage.test.ts` | `web/src/views/Todos.tsx` |
| iOS / Mac | `apple/Shared/TodoTriage.swift` (`TodoTriageLogic`) | `apple/PersonaTests/TodoTriageTests.swift` | `apple/Persona/Views/Todos/TodosView.swift`, `apple/Mac/Todos/MacTodosPage.swift` |
| Android | `android/core/domain/src/main/kotlin/persona/core/domain/tasks/TodoTriage.kt` | `android/core/domain/src/test/kotlin/persona/core/domain/tasks/TodoTriageTest.kt` | `android/feature/agents/src/main/kotlin/persona/feature/agents/TodosScreen.kt` |
| Hub | `server/internal/assistant/todo_triage.go` | `server/internal/assistant/todo_triage_test.go` | none: it tells when a leader's task is stuck (#3483) |

The shared cases in `spec/fixtures/triage` are read by the web app (`web/src/lib/todo-triage-fixture.test.ts`) and the
hub; a rule change adds or changes a case there first.

A change to the rules changes all of them in the same PR. Native differences: iOS / Mac keep restores in the device's
`UserDefaults` (`todos.restored`) and Android in its local preferences, as the web keeps them per browser; the iOS list
has no Status | Folder switch (it had no folder view), and the Mac shows a merged row's members as a disclosure under the
lead. Moving the classification to the hub, so the clients only draw the section it sends, would remove the copies; it
is not done yet.
