Add --platform mac (anywhere) for the Mac app's builds: same App Store Connect record and groups, its own builds.
Without it every command means the iPhone builds, so a Mac build never gets the iPhone build's notes or vice versa.

"wait" and "info" also hand the build to the external group when the config has app_store.external, so every new
TestFlight build reaches the external testers too (after Beta App Review); a failure there never fails the release.
A build can't be submitted while another of its version is in review; "catch-up" submits it once that is over. Nor
while App Store Connect's limit on review submissions is used up (422 SUBMISSION_LIMIT_REACHED): that prints one line
and a later "catch-up" submits it. Dropped connections are tried again in scripts/release/asc.py (#4034).

Internal testers (app_store.testers in the config) must be users of the team in App Store Connect.
External testers join the group by its public link when app_store.external.public_link is true (at most
public_link_limit people; 0 or unset means no limit), and/or get an email invitation when listed in app_store.external.testers. Without the
public link only those emails can join. The first build of a version goes through Beta App Review, which needs the
contact in app_store.external.review (docs/operations/release.md).
Groups are found by name and kind, the oldest one when several share a name; only "setup" and "external" create
a missing group, because App Store Connect sometimes lists them incompletely (#945). The App ID comes from app_store.app_id in the config (docs/operations/config.md).
