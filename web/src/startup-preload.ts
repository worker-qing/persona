 * to strings off the first screen from moving the count (#5145 moved ja 34 B as sent with no first-screen code changed).
 * And 2,624 B for child sessions folded into their parent (#5120 added 2,596 B to ja as counted, 591,150 B at dc5d1e3a3
 * to 593,746 B: every list's folding and the parent row's folded state and running line, a child's request counted,

 * placement of its children's cards, the hook that reads and holds their rows and the old child links' redirect; the
 * child card and what it reads when opened load with the card). And 256 B for a launcher switch that waits (#5035 added
 * 77 B to ja as counted, 593,746 B to 593,823 B: the pill's waiting state, the Agent chat sending the switch with the
 * user's message and keeping the words in the box when it is refused; the panel's switch code and words load with the
 * panel). And 13 B for the background supervisor (#5082: ja counts 594,043 B with it, built on main at a5747f46b; the
 * rest of what it adds fits the room main had: lib/background-supervisor.ts, which the sidebar, the conversation menu,
 * the chat's header and its review line read, the store's re-read of the assistant for a supervisor made since, the
 * line's reviewer, and its name and "Built-in"; the switch, the model row and their words are in the lazy Settings
 * page). And 238 B for the work summary's review fixes (#5155: ja counted 594,228 B with them against 594,043 B on main
 * at 4885b1458, +185 B; 594,241 B merged with main at ebcb0fa62, plus 40 B of room: the duration units back in the
 * catalogs as CLAUDE.md asks of user-facing words, wordless thoughts left out before grouping, rows spinning while the
 * exchange runs; the thought row and its parser stay lazy). And 371 B for model quotas, prices and composer usage
 * (#5176, #5208: ja 594,414 B before #5155's review fixes: the composer's quota and the context meter's model price,
 * the pill's model-panel handoff and the quota helpers; the panel's prices and quota rows and their words load with
 * the panel). A Codex opened with no first message (#4961) moved ja as counted by +223 B against b0a4a08b5 (594,241 B
 * to 594,464 B) and by -80 B against 449a12d7f (593,469 B to 593,389 B), inside the room either way: the waiting chat's
 * note, its box's placeholder, the page following the pane to the thread the first message began, their words and
 * the list row's line (New Agent's optional first message is in its lazy dialog). And 498 B for the changed-files card
 * and the error notices (#5157: ja 595,110 B against 593,659 B on main at f6f07e375, +1,451 B, of which 993 B fit the
 * room main had, plus 40 B of room: the card at the end of a finished Agent exchange, its count of the exchange's own
 * edits without drawing their diffs (lib/turn-changes.ts) and of a fold's `changes`, its review and file targets, the
 * store read of the session's folder, the feed cache's check of `changes`, the shared ErrorNotice the model-error and
 * usage-limit lines become, their marks and words). Raise it on purpose, in the change that needs it.
