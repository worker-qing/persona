// The safety net under a chat's live stream (#3139): the page follows a session by WebSocket pushes, and when one is lost
// (a socket that looks open but is not, a queue the hub had to drop) it used to stay behind until a reload. The session
// list keeps coming over the same socket and says the transcript grew: its `rev` moved since the page's newest read was
// sent, or its `updated_at` is newer than the newest item the page holds. Then, once nothing has come for a while, the
// page asks for what it is missing once (`items?after_seq=`), applies it silently, and only says "Not live" when that
// keeps being needed. iOS / Mac follow the same rule and numbers (`AgentSyncPacing.catchUpAt`).
//
// The rev catches the last line of a burst whose push was lost (#1179): its `updated_at` is within `STALE_SLACK_MS` of
// the line before, which the page holds. A push never settles a moved rev, as nothing says which lines the rev was
// for: the list comes from the node's poll and the push from its transcript watch, so a list can come before the push
// for an earlier line, and the lost line behind it. Only a read sent after the move does. The node reports revs on its
// next tick, mostly after the items they belong to, so this costs one empty read each time an open chat goes quiet.
