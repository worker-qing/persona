// Agent, the hub folds the others under it as its workers (lib/team.ts, #5180): the lists hold the lead alone and its page
// has them in its Team panel, so a tab here lists several panes only when they are peers. Hosts without tabs (Paseo, botmux, runtimes) list their sessions right under the
// space; sessions outside any space go to the machine's "Other". Shell panes never reach the hub, so they are not here.
// A space the host nests under another (Orca's child worktrees, `parent_space_id`) is listed inside its parent, as
// Orca's sidebar does with "N children"; when the parent has no live agent the child stays at the top (#2073).
