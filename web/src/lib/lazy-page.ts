// Pages a first screen doesn't need (App.tsx, #1996) are their own chunks, loaded on their first render or ahead of it
// (preloadPages). Ahead of it in two ways, so only what is likely next is fetched: the few marked `idle` (the overlays a
// shortcut opens, small parts drawn inside content; about 29 KB gzip together) once the browser is idle after start
// (#1954, carried over from #1974), and every other page when the pointer, the focus or a finger reaches a link to one
// of its `routes`, so its chunk is on the way before the click. A page opened another way (a menu row, a shortcut) loads
// as it renders. A page whose chunk is in renders at once, without a round through Suspense (React.lazy suspends once
// even for a module that is already loaded); one still on its way shows the Suspense fallback, as with Data Saver, and
// is drawn the moment its chunk is in. A failed load (the hub was redeployed under the page, or it is offline) is not
// kept: the next render, preload or link asks again, and PageBoundary shows it in the meantime.
