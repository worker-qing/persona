// The page's voice call: at most one at a time, bound to the conversation page that started it (docs/assistant/voice.md
// 6.3, 6.5; docs/web/web.md "Voice chat"). A new call ends the one before; leaving the conversation (or closing the tab)
// ends it; a hidden tab keeps it (desktop multitasking) unless the browser suspends its audio. ChatView reads only whether
// a call is on here; the bar and the thread's tail read the call itself.
//
// This is the first screen's part: the store, its hooks and what the page's buttons call. The call's own code (the
// conversation, its audio, uplink and resampling: call-stack.ts) is a chunk of its own, imported when the page's first
// call starts; until then the call's types are all this module takes from it.
