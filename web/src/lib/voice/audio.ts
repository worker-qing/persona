// The browser's microphone and speaker for a call (docs/web/web.md "Voice"): getUserMedia with the browser's echo
// cancellation, noise suppression and gain control; an AudioWorklet (capture.worklet.ts) that resamples the context's
// audio to the extension's input rate in 20 ms PCM16 frames; and a second AudioContext at the voice's output rate that
// plays the PCM it sends back to back, with no gap, until `clear` drops all of it.
//
// Both contexts are made inside the click that starts the call (audio-contexts.ts): a browser lets audio start only from
// a user's gesture, and the microphone's permission prompt comes after. The constructor makes them, as it runs in the
// click; the first call of a page, whose code loads after the click, gets the ones the click made (calls.ts).
//
// The capture context's output is never exact silence. Its clock is what drives the worklet, so it is what sends the
// 50 frames a second; Chrome moves a context whose output has been all zero for 30 seconds from the audio device to a
// timer-driven fake sink (its "silent sink suspender", to save power), and that sink can run far slower than real time
// (a quarter of it in a headless Chrome on macOS): the worklet then makes a quarter of the frames and the extension hears
// a quarter of what was said. A ConstantSourceNode adds KEEP_AWAKE_LEVEL to the output instead: a constant (no sound at
// any frequency) far below what a 24-bit converter can output, so nothing is heard and the tab is not marked as playing
// audio, but not zero, so the context stays on the device. The microphone itself never reaches the output (no
// monitoring): it goes into the worklet only, and the worklet's output, which it never writes, goes through a gain of 0.
// The player context is left as it was: its clock only times the voice's chunks, and a sink Chrome moved it to in a long
// silence between replies goes back to the device once there is something to play. CapturePace logs (console.debug)
// when the frames fall behind the wall clock all the same.
