// than the current one (an inbox item's hand-off, a link, the palette, a to-do's origin), and the page must open it on
// the computer it runs on: what this tab noted at a hand-off (lib/outbox.ts adoptConversation) is gone after a reload
// and in a new tab, and a hub with the paged sessions list pushes no rows to look it up in. So the address names the
// computer (`?machine=`) and, when it is another manager's than the default, the manager (`?manager=`); the page asks the
// hub for that exact row, which the rest (its manager's offline state, its plan buttons) then reads (docs/web/web.md).
// One assistant: the plain address, as before.
