// Pausing the upstream (docs/assistant/voice.md 4.9 "Suspension", protocol 2 only). A realtime session is billed by the second, silence
// included (docs/lessons/voice.md "Other behavior": a 15-minute session the model hardly spoke in was billed 948 s), and an
// agent's turn often takes minutes. So while the bound conversation works on something (or a run of the call's waits
// on its background work or on something outside: what it brings back is still to come), nobody has spoken for
// pauseAfter (the user by their voice, captions or typed lines; the model by its speech as it plays, its handovers;
// the extension by what it told the model), nothing waits to be said, no card is asked and no handover waits for its
// call, the upstream session is closed: the app's socket and the runs stay, the app is told link{paused}, and no
// heartbeat is said while it lasts (it would only wake the upstream to say that the work goes on).
//
// It wakes as soon as there is something to say (a result, a card, a refusal: whatever deliver queues), when the user
// types a line, or when the app's audio has had the user's voice in it for wakeVoice (by the audio's own length, gaps
// between words up to bargeGap; their voice is what pacing.heard says it is, over voiceRMS and over the noise floor, so
// the zero frames a muted app sends never wake it). The app is told link{waking}, a new session is opened as after a
// drop (connect: the bound conversation's snapshot taken again while the socket connects, what was said, the runs
// still waited on) and link{live} once it is up. Meanwhile the app's audio of the last ringSpan is kept and sent to
// the new session first, so what the user says as it wakes (about 1.1–1.6 s on the measured service, lessons
// "Recommended constants") is not lost; lines typed meanwhile go after it. Nothing is said before that has gone out.
//
// The old session's delegations went with it: what comes back for them is said (its words carry the task). Pausing
// and waking are not drops: they do not count toward maxReconnects (a session paused after pauseAfter held
// stableAfter, which starts that count over); a wake is tried wakeMost times in a row before the call ends
// (upstream_failed).
