// the same time can be told apart and what happened in one can be told afterwards: how it started (protocol, target,
// model, tools), its upstream sessions, every handover and the user-speech gate's decision on it, every run's states
// and sends to the hub, the cards asked, and how it ended.

// counts and times only, so the log can be shared.
