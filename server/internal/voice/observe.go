// What the bound conversation does that the call did not hand over, and how a turn that is not over yet is told
// (docs/assistant/voice.md "Per-round tracking", "Announcements", #3503).
//
// Observed runs (protocol 2): the call watches the conversation it is bound to from ready on. When it works and no run
// of the call's is on it (none being sent, none held), the turn it works on is followed as a run of its own: the user
// opened the call while it worked, or it began a turn for another reason (a message typed on the phone or at the
// computer, a wake-up, a task reporting back). Bound to an agent, its answer is said as any run's is. Bound to a Persona
// conversation (the main one, another), a turn that came by another channel (a chat app's bot, a scheduled task) is
// only mentioned, once a channel a call (voice/observed): its answer went back there. Protocol 1 has no fixed target
// (the main conversation of the moment): no observed runs. Not observed either: the turn the user just stopped
// ("Stop:", its state behind the stop), and a turn of a message the call sent whose send ended unknown (it got there
// after all: followed as the call's run).
//
// A turn of an agent that stopped is not always over, and what says so is the hub's triage of it (docs/assistant/agent-work.md),
// when the user turned it on: about triage_settle_seconds (15 s) plus a model call after the turn stopped. A model
// error the manager goes on from ("Continue") is not the end: a turn that stopped on a model error waits for that triage when
// the manager would go on (auto_continue), and while it says a "Continue" is due. A turn it says waits on something outside
// (a deploy, CI, another agent) is told once (voice/progress#waiting) and then waited on: the answer of a turn that
// stopped is said at once (the user does not wait for the triage), and the run is kept until the triage of that turn
// is in; when it says the turn waits, the run goes on, blocked, and its later turns (the manager wakes the agent) are
// the call's, each waiting for its triage, since a woken turn often stops on the same wait. While it works with nothing
// heard in the call for heartbeatAfter, the user hears that it still works: the sort of step and how long, nothing it
// wrote (voice/progress).
