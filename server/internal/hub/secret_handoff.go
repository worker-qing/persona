// The hand-off card's gate (docs/extensions/secret-providers.md "Who may approve a hand-off"). A hand-off card
// (proto.SecretHandoffTool) hands secret values to one Agent run once it is approved, so only a full device approves it,
// from the card itself: the approval request declares featureSecretHandoff in its own X-Persona-Features header
// (requestDeclares; a connection's client_hello does not count, or every request of that app, a lock-screen button's
// included, would). An answer-only device (the watch), an extension's token, the hub's own token and a request without
// the feature (Android, the Mac app, an older app, a notification's or a widget's button) get 403
// secret_handoff_elsewhere, and the refusal is recorded on every provider the card names
// (extwire.AuditSecretHandoffRefused), once per card, credential and reason in handoffRecordEvery. A plain no (deny,
// dismiss, cancel: proto.SecretHandoffDeclines) goes through from any of them.
//
// The feature is the client's word: it keeps a client that does not show the card from approving one blindly. It is no
// boundary between the owner's own full credentials, any of which may do whatever the owner may.
//
// The device that may approve goes to the manager in HTTPRequest.HandoffApprover, never in a header, on an answer to a
// hand-off card and on one to a card the hub does not hold (after a restart, before the manager reported its cards
// again): the manager approves a hand-off only with it, so it checks the cards the hub could not. A card's push never
// offers buttons (interactionPayloadIn), and the Live Activity shows it without Allow / Deny (assistant/fleet_live.go).

// featureSecretHandoff: the request approving a hand-off card comes from the card itself, which its client shows whole
// (what is handed over, from where, to which Agent on which computer). A client sends it on that request only, never in
// a header every request carries, nor from a notification, a widget, the Live Activity, the watch or Siri.
