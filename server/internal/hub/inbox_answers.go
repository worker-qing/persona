// The merged inbox (GET /api/v1/inbox naming no manager) is what every app asks for again after each inbox push and
// on every connect. A push to k apps had each manager list, encode and send its whole inbox k times, and the hub scan,
// localize, merge and gzip it k times, all for the same bytes. So an answer every manager gave with a 2xx is kept a
// moment (inboxAnswerTTL) and given to the requests that would have asked for it again while nothing it came from
// has moved:
//
//   - the request: its path and query (the query's keys sorted), its caller's role, its language, and the managers it
//     asks, in order (listManagers);
//   - each manager's inbox generation, and a global one. A manager's moves when it tells the apps {"type":"inbox"}
//     (relayBroadcastFrom, before they get the push), and before and after any request that is no GET or HEAD passes
//     to it (relayHTTP, relayTo): a client that changed something and then lists sees what it changed. The global one
//     moves with the roster and the default (ownersChanged).
//
// An answer fetched while a generation moved is not kept. Requests that come while the same one is being fetched
// wait for it, each as long as its own context lets it, and fetch for themselves when it did not come out a 2xx from
// every manager. A request that names a manager, an extension's (it is its manager's) and one with a body go the way
// they went (mergeList). What is kept is the status, the merge's own headers and its bytes, none of what the
// middleware set (X-Request-Id, Cache-Control), and the bytes gzipped once for the first request that takes gzip:
// those go out with the headers gzipResponses would have set, and it passes them as they are (gzip.go).
//
// A request that sends If-None-Match gets the answer's tag (ETag W/"i1-<hash>") when every manager answered with a
// 2xx, and 304 when the tag it sent is that one: a refetch after a push that changed nothing this client sees costs
// a few hundred bytes instead of the whole list. The tag hashes the bytes the request gets but for the value of the
// top-level as_of, which is the moment of each listing. A request without it gets no tag and the same answer as
// before (docs/protocol/protocol.md "Inbox validator").
