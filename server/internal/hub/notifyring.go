// The notify events kept for a device that has no push route while it has no ws_notify socket (#4043). APNs keeps an
// iPhone's alert until the phone is back, but an Android phone or a browser hears of a question or a finished turn only
// on its WebSocket, and notifyWSFrom sends to live sockets alone: a device that was away at that moment (a network
// change, Doze, a frozen app) never got the notification, only the card in its lists. So the hub keeps, per such device,
// the events notifyWSFrom selected for it, its settings (manager mutes, Phone Muted, quiet hours, "Finished") decided
// at that moment exactly as for a live socket, and sends them after the client_hello of its next connection, skipping
// the cards resolved meanwhile. Clients collapse them with their usual notification tags. In memory only: a hub restart
// loses them, as it loses the sockets (docs/protocol/protocol.md "Notifications over the persistent connection (ws_notify)").
