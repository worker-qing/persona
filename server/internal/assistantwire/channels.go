// Which conversation a channel talks to, following the turn and sending its answer back, what is asked there and its
// answer, the commands, the pushes and the sync mirror are the assistant's; the hub keeps the transport — the Feishu
// open platform's long connection and REST (pairing among them), the plugins' channel programs — and hands the
// assistant what comes in. The channels' routes are the assistant's (Routes) but binding (POST …/bind: credentials,
// sign-in fields, pairing): no secret of a channel or the bot passes through the assistant. /api/v1/bots/feishu* stays
// the hub's. What answers a card in a channel carries the owner's action (InteractionsOwnerAction): the hub issued
// it when it handed the owner's press or message over, and takes it once — the assistant can't approve anything on
// its own.
