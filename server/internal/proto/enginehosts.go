// phone go unless the start says otherwise. The single engines before it (EngineNames) are sets of one; herdr-both
// is {herdr, herdr-core} with herdr the default. The hub keeps both forms: the set for nodes that take one
// (NodeInfo.EngineSets), the single engine for older nodes and for a rollback to an older hub.
