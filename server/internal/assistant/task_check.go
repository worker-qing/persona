// task's work (autoFinishTask, done.go) is kept on the todo as its check, the verdict with its reason in the user's
// language, so an open task whose agents stopped can say why it is not done ("Stopped, not done yet · waiting for CI").
// It is kept with the task's stage and delivery (reportStagesKey: no migration), and only while the judgment is still
// current. A new turn of one of its agents (taskWorking) or a reopen (setTodoRow) clears it: it judged earlier work.

// TodoCheck is the hub's latest automatic completion judgment of a task (Todo.Check): Verdict one of done, not_done,

// WorkSince the start of the stretch of work it judged.
