// on) the ask goes out as a Feishu card with "Pass" on it; without, it is kept all the same (NoCard) and the briefing, the
// board and the web app show it. "Pass" (the button, a reply saying so, or the web Accept button) marks the task verified; any other reply to the card is written into the todo's
// decisions and sent to the agent that did the work. One still not accepted is asked again the next morning.
