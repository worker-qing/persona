// Parked tasks (#3804, docs/assistant/todos.md "Parked tasks"). A supervised task that only waits — for the owner to say
// what comes first, for someone else, for something outside to happen, for a date — is no decision, so needs_user is
// refused for it. Its supervisor parks it instead (task_review parked): one sentence of what it waits for, what kind
// of thing that is, and until when. A parked task stays open and is nobody's to answer: no ask, no push, no conclusion
// card, and none of the signals that say work stopped (stalled, idle, orphaned, overdue, undecidable). At its time its
// supervisor gets one parked_due signal: decide, park again with a new reason, or close it. Its agent starting a turn
// (someone sent it something) ends the parking, and it is supervised as before. Parking again and again is the old
// habit under a new name, so the parks in a row with no agent turn between them are counted, and one past maxReparks
// re-parks is refused. Only waiting_on owner_priority concerns the owner: the daily digest lists it, never Needs you.
