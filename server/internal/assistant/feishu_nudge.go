// The nudge under a card nobody answered (#6084, docs/extensions/bots.md "Nudging a card nobody answered"): a card the Lark bot
// sent (a question, a plan, a permission) that has waited nudge_after without an answer gets one short reply under it,
// "Still waiting for you: …", so it reaches the user where they answer. Like the reply reminder (agents_reply.go) it is
// a sweep once a minute over what waits, rules only, costing no tokens; unlike it, it follows the card into Lark and
// does not need the card to have been seen.
//
// One nudge per card, ever: the card's record (botCardRef) keeps when it was nudged, so a restart does not nudge again.
// None for a card answered, dismissed or expired (its record is gone), or whose agent is gone. The hub's quiet hours
// (#5806) hold a nudge back: it goes out in the first sweep after them, if the card still waits.

// nudgeEvery is how often the cards are looked at, the reply reminder's.
