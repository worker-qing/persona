// for the main conversation's task_review, the main conversation is the bottleneck once there are many. With
// assistant.review_sample_percent below 100, the done judge also checks each done_when criterion (taskAutoCheck); a
// task whose criteria are all checkable and met and whose work is live is closed by the judge itself (its review is
// the judge's, with the checks), and only a fixed share of those (spotChecked) still comes to the main conversation.
// A task that fails the check waits for task_review as before. At 100 (the default) the judge checks nothing more and
// every finished task waits for task_review.

// reviewerJudge marks a review the done judge made itself (TaskReview.By).
