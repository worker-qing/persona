// docs/design/proposals/main-chat-availability.md): how long the owner waits for an assistant conversation's reply,
// what its rounds are spent on, how long system messages wait in its queue, and who answers the cards. Everything is
// a work event (session_work_events, kept 30 days like the others): one per answered owner message, per round, per
// delivered queued message and per ended card. Nothing here calls a model or reads a transcript.
