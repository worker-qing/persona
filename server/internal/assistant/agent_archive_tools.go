// The assistant archiving coding agents' sessions when the user asks (agent_archive, agent_unarchive): the same
// manager-owned, reversible archive the apps use (setAgentArchive, agent_archives.go), and with close the apps'
// "Archive and close" (archiveAndCloseAgentSession, agent_archive_close.go). Nothing is ever deleted.
//
// Archiving and restoring change nothing on the computer and are undone with one call, so they are not confirmed
// (as conversation_archive is not). Closing the agent on its computer is confirmed on the phone every time (a
// permission card, as persona_settings asks), and a busy agent is refused before the card is shown; the manager checks
// again when it closes. The answer says what happened in the words the assistant repeats to the user: archived or
// not, what the agent's own tool did (native archive), and whether the agent was closed, or why it is still open.
