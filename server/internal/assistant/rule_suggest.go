// A rule after the same answer three times (#4929, docs/assistant/unified-entry.md "A rule after the same answer
// three times"). When the owner gave the same answer to the same kind of card for the same scope ruleSuggestAfter
// times within ruleSuggestWindow, the next card of that kind and scope carries a proto.RuleSuggestion: Always makes
// the rule, Not now silences the line for ruleQuietFor. Three kinds:
//
//   - plan_start: Start on plan cards for tasks that change files in one directory of one computer. Always adds the
//     tasks.trust entry "Start these directly" adds.
//   - standing_authorization: the go-ahead for merge, push or deploy-test in one directory of one computer (a decision's
//     option, or Yes to a plain confirmation). Always grants a standing authorization for it, with the owner's answer
//     as the quote, through the checks and the store every grant goes through.
//   - delegate: a question a supervisor passed up, answered with what it recommended. Always stores no rule: the
//     suggestion names the agents.delegate setting.
//
// Nothing is counted in a table of its own: the plans the owner started (task_plans, PlanTask.OwnerStarted), the
// decisions kept on to-dos (todo_decisions) and the ask_escalated and owner_decided work events are read when a card
// is made. The tap
