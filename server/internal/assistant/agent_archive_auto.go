// Archiving closed sessions by themselves (docs/assistant/todos.md "Closed sessions archive themselves", #3618). A
// finished task's agent is closed a few minutes after the task (tasks_close.go) and an idle one after half a day
// (tasks_idle.go), but the closed session stays in the lists as stopped, and the few agents that matter get lost among
// them. A closed session that has been idle for archive_closed_days, and is on no to-do or only on done ones, is
// archived with the archive the apps use (agent_archives.go): reversible, nothing is deleted, it is listed under
// Archived, and a message to it restores and resumes it as ever.
//
// Never archived (autoArchivable): a session still in a host (a pane or an engine host, whatever state the host
// reads), or working, starting or with background work; one
// with a card waiting or queued input; one the manager is to wake or continue (session_work); one linked to an open
// to-do; an assistant conversation; a review's reviewer; a subagent's row; a session another tool owns (its archive
// would also move it in that tool); with no to-do, one whose last words ask the user something.
