// outlives its node for its hook to claim again), a TUI dialog read off the screen (a "screen" card the manager
// answers itself with keys), a Codex question or approval the node lists, the assistant's own questions and cards,
// and what the hub's own features ask (fleet.ask). They are kept here, recorded in the interactions table, told the
// hub (fleet.interaction / fleet.interaction_resolved), pushed (fleet_push.go), and answered through the hub's
// relayed route (fleet_routes.go).
