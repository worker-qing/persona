// reading as in progress after its agents are gone: one ended on a model error nothing retries and its tab was closed,
// the user closed the tab, or its computer went offline. When every agent of an open to-do is closed or offline and
// the manager has nothing pending that brings one back (a wake, a "Continue", a card, queued input: session_work), the
// to-do is orphaned, with why. GET /api/v1/todos carries it (`orphaned`), the snapshot's task line says it, and a
// supervised task's supervisor is told once (the signal `orphaned`, supervise_signals.go).
//
// Not orphaned: a done to-do; one with no agent yet (it has not started, or its start failed: start_remedy.go); a
// supervised task waiting for its review or for the user's decision (it waits on them, not on an agent); one with an
// agent that is an assistant conversation (a message always reaches it).
