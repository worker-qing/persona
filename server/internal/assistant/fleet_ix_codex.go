// ---- Codex cards (docs/integrations/codex.md "Questions and approvals") ----

// A node lists the Codex questions and approvals open on its machine whenever the list changes (codex.interactions,
// node/codexask.go); the manager keeps a card for each — a new one is announced, one no longer listed (answered at
// the computer, the turn interrupted, the agent gone) ends. An answer goes back to the node (codex.answer), which
// types it into the TUI and says whether Codex took it: that error reaches whoever answered.

// codexAnswerTimeout: the node checks the screen, types, and waits for Codex to take the answer (its codexConfirm).

// codexAnnouncedFor: which cards were announced (pushed) lately is remembered this long: a node that reconnects
// lists them again, and the phone should not ring twice for one question.

// approval in a later turn has the same id), not a reconnect or a screen read that failed once: it rings the phone
// again (#3766).
