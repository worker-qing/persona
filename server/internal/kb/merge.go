// MergeMessages writes lines into a chat's day files at their place in time, for messages that may be older than
// what the files hold (imported history; AppendMessages only appends, so an older message would land out of order).
// It returns how many lines it added.
//
// Each day file it touches is read whole and written back atomically (writeFile: a temporary file renamed over it),
// and the rewrite never changes what was there: every existing line stays byte for byte, in its order, including
// headers, blank lines, lines it cannot parse, lines out of time order and duplicates already present
// (TestMergeKeepsEveryLine). A new line goes in front of the first existing message line of a later minute ("- 15:04 …"
// as Line.Format writes them), after every line before it: a line it cannot read, or a message's continuation, stays
// with the line above it. A new line without a later one goes at the end. New lines going to the same place keep
// their time order, and lines of one minute the order they came in.
//
// Day files hold no message ids, so a duplicate is a line that formats the same: the same minute, sender and text
// (a message the live archive already has, the same page read twice after a restart). The attachments at the end of
// a line count the same however they were written (dupKey): the live archive links what it saved, history writes a
// placeholder naming the kind. A duplicate is dropped, against the file and within lines.
