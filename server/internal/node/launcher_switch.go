// Switching a running Claude Code Agent to another launcher (model provider) of the same engine (#5035,
// docs/integrations/claude-integration.md "Switching a running Agent to another provider"). Claude Code takes its
// gateway, key and model from the environment it starts with, so no command typed into it changes them: the agent is
// quit and the same conversation resumed (`--resume <id>`) through the other launcher, in the same terminal. That
// happens with the user's next message from the chat, not when the provider is picked:
//
//   - session.modes with a launcher other than the session's own checks the pick (planSwitch) and keeps it as the
//     session's pending switch (Session.pending_switch); the session's own launcher drops one that waits
//     (launcherModes). A pick made against a launcher the session no longer runs on (from) is refused as stale.
//     Nothing is quit or typed then.
//   - The next session.send with apply_switch (the user's message from the chat that shows the switch; any other
//     sender's goes on the launcher the agent runs on) carries it out inside its turn (applySwitch). While the agent
//     works, waits for the user, starts or has background work a quit would end, the message goes on its launcher as
//     always and the switch waits for a later one. Otherwise everything is worked out first (the launcher's checks,
//     the conversation's directory, the model to run, how to come back), the agent is looked at once more, and only
//     then quit with Ctrl+C; once only a shell is in front and no claude has the conversation open any more, the
//     launcher's command runs in that shell with --resume, as the user's Resume does in a kept terminal. Then the
//     message is typed to the new agent. Meanwhile the session is listed as starting: messages and the user's Resume
//     wait for it, stop and archive refuse.
//   - A switch that fails is dropped, whatever failed (refused by the checks, an agent that did not quit, a start that
//     did not come up), so nothing tries it again by itself; nothing of the message is typed. A start that did not
//     come up has its pane cleared of what it left (a claude on a sign-in screen) and the agent resumed on its own
//     launcher in the same shell (switch_failed); when even that does not come up, the agent has stopped
//     (switch_failed_stopped): Resume on its terminal page brings it back on its own launcher.
//
// What is refused, and why: only a Claude Code Agent running in a terminal Persona can type into (a Codex or another
// CLI keeps its launcher, a runtime runs its sessions itself, an assistant conversation switches in its own chip), on
// a launcher Persona can tell (one it started it with, or one its process's environment names: coming back needs it);
// a launcher that is on this computer and runs Claude Code; with a model, one that passes --model on (not locked);
// without one, a launcher whose default model can be seen (resumed without --model, Claude Code would go on with the
// model of the launcher it ran on, #2487); and one whose Claude config directory holds the conversation at its latest:
// --resume looks there only, and the sign-in is kept there too, so a launcher of another profile would answer "No
// conversation found", or run on another account. A launcher whose directory cannot be told (a script the probe cannot
// follow, a probe or login shell that failed) is let through: a resume that finds no conversation ends the start, and
// the switch rolls back.
//
// The pending switch is kept in the session's state record (the hub's Postgres): a node restart neither drops it nor
// carries it out without a message. A session Persona did not start has no record and gets none for this (a record
// means "Persona started it", docs/lessons/agents.md): its switch waits in the node's memory, and a node restart
// forgets it, so its row shows no pending switch any more and nothing is switched behind the user's back. A switch
// picked more than switchMaxAge ago is dropped when a message comes.
//
// Time: the checks before the quit take at most switchProbeWait; from the first Ctrl+C on, everything runs on its own
// clock (the caller going away does not leave the agent half switched), at most switchBudget: the quit (about 8 s),
// the shell coming back (switchExitWait), the start on the new launcher (switchStartWait), and after a failed one the
// pane cleared again and the start on its own launcher (the same bounds). The hub waits switchSendWait for a message
