// A Persona conversation's queue (#4342). A message to a headless claude that is busy waits in Claude Code's own
// queue until its next step takes it in (mid-turn) or its turn ends. Its transcript notes the wait with no words
// (queue-operation enqueue without content, unlike a terminal's), so the node follows its stdout instead: every user
// message goes in with an id of the node's, and Claude Code's command_lifecycle says what became of that id
// (queued, started, cancelled, completed). The ones queued and not started yet are the session's Queued, shown above
// the composer as an Agent's typed-ahead input is (proto.Session.Queued).
//
// The queue strip's actions reach them over stream-json, not keys (an Agent's are keys in its pane, queue.go):
//   - take back, delete, move: cancel_async_message drops a waiting message by its id (cancelled false: it was
//     taken in meanwhile, and stays where it went); moved ones are written again in the new order, with new ids.
//   - send now: an interrupt with send_now, Claude Code's own send-now: the waiting messages reach the model at once,
//     whatever the turn was doing goes to the background or stops ("stopped"), and they start the next request.
//
// Measured on Claude Code 2.1.322. One that sends no command_lifecycle shows no queue, as before; one without these
// control requests answers them with an error, which the strip shows. The Agent SDK bridge forwards neither
// (integrations/agent-sdk, CONTROLS): a conversation on it says so.
