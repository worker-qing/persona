// A runtime that runs Claude Code's command line itself (Paseo, docs/integrations/paseo.md) writes transcripts that
// say "sdk-cli", as a script running `claude -p` does, and the offline list leaves those out (claude_oneshot.go). While
// the runtime lists a session its row is the session. Once it no longer lists it (archived in Paseo: closing a session
// from Persona archives it) only the transcript is left, and nothing in it says whose it was (#4521). So the runtime
// says: beside its rows, a runtime.sessions push names the Claude transcripts on this machine that are sessions of
// its own though it does not list them (unlisted_transcripts). The offline list keeps those as any session not
// running, under its usual window and count. A push without the field says nothing about them (a runtime that was
// just started and has not read its archive yet): what the runtime named before stands. Not for a daemon: its
// transcripts are not on this machine.
