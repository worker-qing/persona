// install 43 of 67 refused turns came in runs, #3204). The main conversation and a scheduled task's ask for the
// configured model with every message (the manager's sendModel), so a fallback that answered would last one turn: the
// next message restarts the process on the refused model, is refused, retried, and moved back again, each restart
// writing the whole prompt cache anew. After a model switch answered, the conversation stays on it for a while, and
// a refusal soon after skips the same-model retry.
