// The assistant's live snapshot (the time, agents waiting, unread chats, today's meetings…) goes at the start of each
// message, in a <persona-context> block, not into the system prompt (docs/assistant/assistant.md "Live snapshots and prefix caching"). The prompt cache
// is a prefix: the system prompt comes before the whole conversation, so a system prompt that differs from one start
// to the next would make every request after a restart write the entire history again. Claude Code (2.1.314) keeps a
// resumed conversation on the system prompt it was first started with instead, so the snapshot there was the one
// from the conversation's first day.
//
// Only the sections that changed since the conversation last got them are sent (the time always): what it has seen
// is kept per conversation in memory and forgotten when it is compacted, which summarizes the old blocks away. A
// node restart forgets it too, and the next message carries the whole snapshot again.

// snapshotSection is one top-level line of the snapshot with the indented lines under it; key is what it is about
// (the "- Lark calendar" part of "- Lark calendar today next: ..." or "- Lark calendar: ...", in Chinese).
