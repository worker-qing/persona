// a hub restart or a reconnect replaces the connection, and with it the Node serving it (attach.go), but the assistant
// processes go on — their turn, their background tasks and monitors — and the Node serving the next connection takes
// them over: what they say from then on reaches the new hub, the answer being generated included. Without a resident
// node (`node --stdio` serving the hub itself) the process ends with the connection, and so do they: Serve returns
// only once reapAssistants has stopped them and they have exited (stopAndWait), or they would go on without a node
// beside the processes the next node starts for the same conversations (#4259).
