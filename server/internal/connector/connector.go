// Package connector is how a source of the user's information (GitHub, iMessage, later Feishu and mail) plugs into
// the hub: one connector per source, and each pipe the hub has — the assistant's tools, writes behind a gate, the
// settings page's status, realtime kicks — picks up what the connector implements, so adding a source does not
// touch those pipes (docs/extensions/connectors.md).
//
// A connector implements Connector, whose Manifest declares its capabilities; the hub finds each declared one's
// interface with As. Runner, Events and Machines are how it runs, found by type assertion.
