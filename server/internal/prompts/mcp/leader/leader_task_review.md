Close, send back or hand up one of the worker tasks you handed out with task_plan. You get this tool only as a task leader, and it reaches your own direct workers only (any other task is refused). accepted: the work meets its done_when (you checked the evidence): the task closes. rework: say what is missing (note, or checks that are not met): it goes to the worker as a message, at most two rounds, after which it goes up as a decision. needs_user: only for a decision that is not yours: reason says what to decide and recommend what you would pick; it goes to whoever handed you your task, and nothing is shown to the user from here. cancelled: not to be done: the task closes and its agent is closed. A worker's supervision message tells you when one needs this.
