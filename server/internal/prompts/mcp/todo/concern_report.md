Report the outcome of one of the user's concerns (a to-do of kind concern, see todo_list kind concern) and close it: main conversation only. Call it in the same reply in which you tell the user the outcome, with report the words you told them, faithfully; it is kept on the concern as a decision of source reported (shown in the app, sent to extensions). It is the only way a concern closes: nothing closes one on its own, and todo_complete refuses it. Report only an outcome the user has actually been told; if the concern is not settled yet, leave it open. A concern the user reopens needs another report.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "report"],
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "the concern's id (todo_…), as todo_list gives it"
    },
    "report": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "what you told the user of its outcome, as you said it in this reply (at most 4000 characters)"
    }
  }
}
