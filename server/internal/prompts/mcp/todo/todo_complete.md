Mark one of the user's Persona to-dos done, when the user says it is done (or asks you to close it). The user's own to-do is closed at once. A task's, or one agents work on, is confirmed on the phone first, because closing it also closes its agents once they are idle; if the user declines, nothing changes. A concern is not closed with this: report its outcome with concern_report.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id"],
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "the to-do's id (todo_…), as todo_list gives it"
    }
  }
}
```
