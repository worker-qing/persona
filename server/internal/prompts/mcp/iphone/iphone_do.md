Act on one of the user's iPhones, in one call: `steps` in order, stopping at the first that fails. A step is `{"action": …}`; a target is an element `{"n": N}` from iphone_look (with its `numbering`), `{"label": "…", "role"?: "…"}`, or a point `{"x": …, "y": …}`. Actions: `tap` {target, count?: 2 for a double tap}, `long_press` {target, ms?}, `drag` {target, to, ms?, hold_ms?}, `swipe` {target?, to} or {direction: up|down|left|right, distance?}, `type` {text, target?: tapped first}, `key` {key: return|backspace|delete|tab|escape|space|up|down|left|right, repeat?}, `button` {button: home|lock|volume_up|volume_down}, `launch` / `terminate` {app: bundle id}, `wait` {ms}. `screenshot: true` adds one after the steps; `timeout_ms` is the time for all of it (default 30000, at most 120000). Read first with iphone_look when unsure what is on screen. Steps that pay, delete, send a message or type a password, and every input on a screen without elements, are asked on the user's phone first (every input, if the user set that); a refusal is the user's, so do not retry it and do not try to approve it yourself. A failure says whether anything reached the iPhone: when it may have, look with iphone_look before doing anything else.
