Search the knowledge base: summaries and metadata of chats, people, projects, docs, meetings, events, recordings (with their minutes and any transcript still retained), topics (curated knowledge points: how something works, what was decided and why, the steps and pitfalls), project timelines, the notes directories the user added (hits with an absolute path) and, with messages=true, the full message archive (newest days first). All words must match. Hits come in the order the files are read, not by relevance, so a broad search can fill the limit with chats: give kind to search one kind only, the entries whose name matches first, then as kb_list ranks them. A past meeting (its decisions, what is still open, who does what) is kind=recordings: found by its title, the calendar event's title, its minutes or any transcript still retained; then kb_get it. Transcripts expire before minutes; do not promise the full transcript of a trimmed recording.
