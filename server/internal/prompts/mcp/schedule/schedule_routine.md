Set up a recurring routine: every day (or on some weekdays) at a time, Persona starts a new conversation with `prompt`, you do the work, and the user gets a push with your answer (with `push: "asked"`, only what you send with notify_user). Use for "每天 9 点给我早报", "每周五下午起草周报". For one-off reminders use schedule_followup. Pass `id` (from list_followups) to change an existing routine: only the fields you give change; `enabled: false` pauses it. A routine can take `until`, an instant after which it stops (RFC 3339 or 30m / 2h / 1d, not a bare clock time): Persona then turns it off and records a skipped run instead of running. Omit `until` to keep an existing routine's end time; null clears it. Times are in the user's time zone. A routine runs on Main chat's launcher, model and thinking effort unless you give it its own: pass `launcher` (a name from machines_list / the launcher list on the computer where its runs start), and `model` / `effort` for that launcher (a model or effort alone pins the launcher it runs on now). An empty `launcher` clears the override and returns the routine to Main chat. Leave these out to keep what the routine has.
