Wake yourself up later: at the given time Persona sends `prompt` into this conversation (or a new one) as if the user wrote it, you do the work, and the user gets a push with your answer (with `push: "asked"`, only what you send with notify_user). Use for "remind me…", "check again in an hour", meeting prep 10 minutes before a meeting, watching something until it changes. `at` is RFC 3339 (2026-10-27T09:50:00+08:00) or relative ("30m", "2h", "1d"). For something to do again and again (a patrol every 30 minutes) pass `every` ("30m", "2h", at least 5m) once: Persona repeats it by itself and the user sees, edits and stops it in the app; never schedule the next run from inside a run. For times an interval can't say (every 30 minutes from 9:00 to 18:30 on weekdays, 10:00 on the 1st of each month) pass `cron` instead of `at` / `every`: a standard 5-field cron expression `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week` read in the user's time zone (`*/30 9-18 * * 1-5`, `0 10 1 * *`, or @hourly / @daily / @weekly / @monthly / @yearly; day of week 0 and 7 are Sunday; when both day fields are restricted, a day matching either runs; runs at least 5 minutes apart). It first runs at its next match and repeats by itself like `every`; a bad expression is refused with what is wrong, and the reply lists the next runs to check. An `every` task can take `until`, an instant after which the task stops (RFC 3339 or 30m / 2h / 1d, the same forms as `at`, not a bare clock time and not a condition to watch for): after that instant Persona turns it off and records a skipped run instead of running. A one-off ignores `until`. Omit it to keep an existing task's end time; null clears it. The task runs on Main chat's launcher, model and thinking effort unless you give it its own with `launcher`, `model` and `effort`; the permission mode stays the user's choice in the app. A follow-up that continues this conversation (`new_conversation` false) runs on that conversation's launcher, so giving it its own needs `new_conversation: true`; the call is refused otherwise.
