Report your direction's progress to the user's work log: leader conversations only (assistant.leaders). Write at the goal level, not the process: what was reached, what is being done now and where it is stuck, what the user has to do, with links to the evidence (merged PR, deployed and checked page, document). Send one when a task of yours was reached and at each report cycle (your scheduled check-in, or the end of a day's work on the direction); not after every step, and never only to say you are still working. It does not message the user: it becomes a progress line of your direction in the work-log extension's card, and the latest one is kept on the direction. What needs the user's decision now still goes by task_review needs_user.
