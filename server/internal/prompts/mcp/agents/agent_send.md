Send a message to an agent as the user would type it (answers its question, tells it to continue, gives new instructions). Queued if the agent is working. Only send what the user asked for. An agent that has stopped (a finished task's agent stops after a few idle minutes, an idle one after hours; its terminal stays) is read-only: the send is refused and nothing is sent. To go on with its work, start a new agent with agent_start in its directory (with the task when it had one) and give it what it needs; only the user can resume a stopped agent, with Resume on its terminal page. A branch the user made that has not run yet is started by its first message. A text of only /exit or /quit stops a running agent (its terminal tab stays) and does nothing to one that has stopped; a finished task's agent is stopped for you, so there is no need to. An agent on a task another conversation supervises is not yours to stop: /exit to it is refused and nothing is sent (the user can close it in the app, or with agent_archive and close once it is idle).

When a dialog holds the agent's terminal the send is refused (dialog_open) with the dialog's first line, and whether it is only a notice that Enter closes ("Enter to continue", no options). Send again with dismiss_notice true to close such a notice first. Confirmations, permissions and pickers are never closed for you: tell the user, or answer them with interaction_answer.

When you hand new work to an agent that runs already (one the user opened, a long-lived one that passes work on), give task from the main conversation: once the text is sent the agent is your supervised task, as agent_supervise makes one (a todo with the text as its notes, the agent on it, done_when, a card in the conversation; 督办 messages, task_review), so the work is tracked instead of only said. Put the criteria in the text too: the agent is told only what the text says. An agent already on one of your tasks takes more of it under the same title (no second task; done_when is updated); a different title is refused, so other work is not filed under that task. An agent on the user's own todo or another conversation's task is refused. Refused means nothing was sent. If the send fails, no task is made. Leave task out, or null, for a reply, a nudge or a decision on work it already has; a task with nothing in it (a blank title, no non-blank done_when, no expect_minutes above 0, no other key) counts as left out too.
