Answer another agent's question for the user, in their place, when they said what to answer or told you to decide. Only a question can be answered this way: a tool permission, a plan and a terminal dialog are theirs to decide in the app, and the assistant's own question is never answered by itself. Every question must be answered by its own wording, with the option labels it offers; free text is not accepted (the user answers that in the app, or you use agent_send). A multi-select takes an array of labels. A card a 督办 message handed you before the user (a task you supervise) is yours to answer when it is the agent's own call: give reason, and the answer is kept as the task's decision; what the user must decide goes to them with ask_escalate.
