Hand the user a plan of one or more tasks for agents on their computers, instead of starting agents yourself. Use it for any work that takes an agent (code, research in a repo, anything longer than a few tool calls); one task per independent piece of work. Check machines_list for current machine resources and availability before choosing a machine. Fill in every field from what you know (the knowledge base, agents_list: which machine works in which directory, the user's habits); the user sees each choice as a chip they can change, with your one-line reason. Read-only tasks, tasks the user asked for themselves (user_requested), and kinds the user told you to start without asking, start at once; the rest wait as a card for the user's 开始. Either way this returns at once: don't wait, carry on. Each queued task is a todo (todo id) whose progress shows in your context snapshot; send to a task's agent with agent_send. Quick things you can do with a tool yourself (a reminder, an event) are not tasks. A task stays on its requested machine by default (machine_policy=fixed), including retries. An unavailable launcher fails there; do not reroute machine-local work. Use machine_policy=flexible only when the task may run on another computer: a failed health check can then move it, and its why says so. The response confirms queued dispatch, not a successful Agent start; inspect the task outcome. From the main conversation or a leader conversation (assistant.leaders) you supervise what you hand out: give each task done_when (results you can check) and expect_minutes; you get a 督办 message when one needs you, and you close it with task_review, not by repeating its agent's words. The answer lists work already going on that looks like the same task: check it before you let both go on. A todo this conversation opened that has no agent yet (one opened from a Lark topic: the message that handed it to you names its id) is the task's own: give that id as the task's todo_id and the agent works on it, instead of a new todo being made; any other todo_id is refused with why.
