Name a direction (a leader conversation, one of assistant.leaders, current or ended): main conversation only. The name is what the app and the work-log extension show for the direction, so make it short and plain, the way the user calls that line of work (「Persona 产品」「基建」), never a conversation title with a date or kind in it. An empty name takes yours away: the direction then shows its knowledge-base project's name, else its conversation title without the date and kind. Whoever names it last, the user in the app or you, that name shows.

    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "the direction's name, at most 40 characters; empty to clear it"
    }
