Review a task you handed out from this conversation (its todo id), after you checked its work yourself: each done_when criterion with its evidence (a PR link and that it merged, CI, a screenshot, what the live system answers) or what is missing. accepted closes the task (its agent is closed once it stays still); rework sends what is missing back to the same agent (resumed if it was closed) — at most 2 rounds; a third is refused unless it carries a decision for the user (the needs_user fields below), and otherwise you accept or cancel; needs_user puts a decision to the user, and only a decision they can answer: it is refused unless it has why_owner (why only they can decide), reason (one sentence: what is to be decided), recommend, options (2 to 4, the recommended first, each with what choosing it leads_to) and cost_of_waiting. When nothing needs the user, don't use it: decide it yourself and send the agent on, send the work back, or close the task; a task that only waits for something is no decision either. The hub adds where the task came from and where it stands, and the decision is listed on the to-do with its options (its conclusion card asks them too; without a card, ask them yourself: ask_user, or notify_user if they are away, as the answer says); cancelled ends it (a duplicate, no longer wanted): its agents are closed and archived, and their waiting cards end. A leader conversation's needs_user also goes to the main conversation. From a conversation other than the main one, on a task it does not supervise, only accepted and cancelled apply: send what is missing to its agent with agent_send. The criteria are the task's brief's as they stand after its logged scope changes (the 督办 message lists them), not what a later hand-over prompt says: write one check per criterion in the same words, and the completion report lists each as met, not met or dropped (with the scope change that dropped it), then also_done. Use it on every task a 督办 message says waits for review; don't accept on the agent's word alone. On a supervised task, accepted and needs_user send the user one conclusion card in Lark: the verdict (done, cannot be done, or needs your decision), reason (one sentence), link (one), and for needs_user your recommend, which the user takes by answering "OK"; so give outcome, reason and link with accepted, and reason and recommend with needs_user, and don't push the same result again. A deployed task already has a "Please verify" card from when its work went live: your accepted passes it for the user (marked verified by you), so they are not asked to press "Pass"; set user_check only when the user should still look at the result themselves (a UI change someone has to see), and then that card, or a new one, waits for them. A needs_user decision has a default and a date: unless why_owner is irreversible or visible_to_others, it takes your recommend by default after 24 hours unanswered (recorded on the to-do as taken at the deadline), or at the deadline you give; irreversible and visible_to_others are never taken by default and are raised to the user again once a day. A decision that waited a day comes back to you once to confirm its facts still hold. Besides the options the user can answer "You decide", "This isn't what I asked for" or "Tell me the background first": that comes back to you in a 督办 message, and nothing is taken.
