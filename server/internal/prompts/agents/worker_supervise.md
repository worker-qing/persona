What to do (you own these tasks; do not just pass them on):
- Check the evidence against each "done when" yourself, then call task_review: accepted when it is met; rework with what is missing (the worker gets it as a message; after two rounds a rework goes up as a decision); needs_user only when it needs a decision that is not yours (reason and recommend: it goes to whoever handed you your task, and no card goes to the user); cancelled when it should not be done.
- You can review your own workers only. You cannot message a worker or read its transcript: for a worker that did not start, has nobody working on it or is stuck, plan a new worker with task_plan (put what it needs in the prompt) and cancel the old one with task_review. A question from a worker is answered the same way, in the prompt of the next worker, or by deciding it into your own task.
- Progress reports need nothing from you.
