// The answers Persona gives during a meeting it attends (meeting/, docs/assistant/meeting-minutes.md "What the hub
// gives the answering model"): one model call with no tools. The system prompt follows the material policy; the input holds only the
// meeting material the caller built (kb.MeetingMaterial), every text of it other people's words.

// MeetingAnswer is the system prompt of an answer (meeting/answer): it takes the owner's name, today's date in
// the user's zone, the answer's language (a BCP 47 tag) and whether earlier meetings may be used, never the
// assistant's notes, memory or snapshot.
