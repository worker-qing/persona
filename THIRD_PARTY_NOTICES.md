# Third-party notices

## Password login WebAssembly client

`web/public/pake/client.wasm` uses `github.com/bytemare/opaque` v0.18.0 (MIT),
its transitive cryptographic dependencies (MIT and BSD), and the Go runtime (BSD).
The build collects their full license texts in a generated
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` under the web build's `pake` output, deployed beside the WASM client at
`/pake/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`. The generated notices must accompany binary distributions.

## Brand marks

`apple/Persona/Resources/Assets.xcassets/Brands` and `apple/PersonaWatch/Assets.xcassets/Brands` hold other products' marks
(`web/src/views/inbox/lark.svg` is a copy of `brand-lark` for the web inbox, and
`android/core/designsystem/src/main/res/drawable/brand_lark.xml`, `brand_claude.xml`, `brand_openai.xml` and `brand_trae.xml`
the same marks as Android vector drawables),
shown next to the service Persona connects to. The marks are trademarks of their owners; using them here does not imply
endorsement. They are drawn as published: not recolored (the one-color OS marks take the distribution's color), not
redrawn.

## Web client

The web client's build writes `third-party-licenses.txt` next to its `index.html` (the hub serves it at
`/third-party-licenses.txt`). It lists every npm package `web/package-lock.json` installs for the client, which is every
package the build can include (xterm, pdf.js, noVNC, KaTeX, Mermaid and its dependencies, SheetJS and the rest), with its
version, the license it is used under, its source and the license text it is published with. `web/third-party-licenses.ts`
writes it, and the build fails (as does `web/third-party-licenses.test.ts` in CI's web tests) when a dependency is under a
license not accepted yet, offers a choice of licenses not made yet, no longer offers the license chosen, or comes without
a license file.

- Choices among offered licenses: DOMPurify (MPL-2.0 or Apache-2.0) is used under Apache-2.0, elkjs (EPL-2.0 or
  GPL-3.0-or-later) under EPL-2.0, JSZip (MIT or GPL-3.0-or-later) under MIT.
- Source of the copyleft code, bundled from the npm releases without changes to it: noVNC (MPL-2.0) at
  https://github.com/novnc/noVNC, elkjs (EPL-2.0) at https://github.com/kieler/elkjs, at the versions
  `third-party-licenses.txt` names.
- khroma's package.json names no license; its LICENSE file grants MIT. isarray, rehype-katex and remark-math (MIT) are
  published without a license file; their entries point at their source.
- Authors' email addresses are left out of the license texts: the published hub binary embeds the web client, and the
  release scan (`scripts/release/check_bundle_privacy.py`) refuses email addresses in it.

## Ovis

Parts of `server/internal/screen` (Claude Code input-box rules) are ported from Ovis, and
`server/internal/screen/testdata/claude-rewind-2.1.304-*` is taken from its screen fixtures.

## JetBrains Mono

The terminal font (`apple/Persona/Resources/Fonts/JetBrainsMono-*.ttf`, v2.304, unmodified). Android carries it too
(`android/feature/terminal/src/main/res/font/jetbrains_mono.ttf`, the same file as the regular weight, and
`android/core/designsystem/src/main/res/font/jetbrains_mono.ttf`), and the website its Latin subset as WOFF2
(`site/public/fonts/jetbrains-mono-latin-400-normal.woff2`, `site/public/fonts/jetbrains-mono-latin-600-normal.woff2`);

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

## Barlow, Manrope, Sora, Unbounded and Noto Serif CJK

Fonts under the same SIL Open Font License 1.1 as JetBrains Mono (its full text is above). Each keeps its license file
beside it.

| Font | Files | Copyright | License file |

## KaTeX, Mermaid and Phosphor Icons

The apps draw formulas and diagrams offline with copies of KaTeX 0.16.22 (`katex.min.js`, `katex.min.css`) and Mermaid
12.3.0 (`mermaid.min.js`) in `apple/Persona/Resources/Render` and `android/core/designsystem/src/main/assets/render`
(the same files), each with its license beside it (`KaTeX-LICENSE.txt`, `mermaid-LICENSE.txt`). The web client takes
the npm packages instead (see "Web client").

`mermaid.min.js` is Mermaid's own bundle and carries its dependencies, among them DOMPurify, used under Apache-2.0, and
elkjs, used under EPL-2.0 (source at https://github.com/kieler/elkjs). The web client's generated notices list the same
packages with their license texts.

The Android app's icons (`android/core/designsystem/src/main/kotlin/persona/core/designsystem/icons/PhIcons.kt`) are
generated from Phosphor Icons by `scripts/assets/gen_phosphor_icons.py`; the license is in
`android/core/designsystem/src/main/assets/licenses/MIT-phosphor-icons.txt`.

| Component | Source | Copyright |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KaTeX | https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX | Copyright (c) 2013-2020 Khan Academy and other contributors |
| Mermaid | https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid | Copyright (c) 2014 - 2022 Knut Sveidqvist |

## BeautifulUI

`apple/Packages/BeautifulUI` (the chat's thoughts and tool chips) is BeautifulUI, a SwiftUI port of Beautiful UI
(https://www.beautifului.dev/), copied in as a local Swift package (`apple/Packages/BeautifulUI/VENDORED.md`).
The package directory keeps both licenses (`LICENSE`, `LICENSE-beautifului`) and `NOTICE`.

The web client (`web/`) uses Beautiful UI's design tokens, keyframes and component grammar directly (`web/src/styles.css`,
the views under `web/src/`), reimplemented in React against Persona's data; Beautiful UI's license is the one in
`apple/Packages/BeautifulUI/LICENSE-beautifului` (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Shane Levine).

## SwiftNIO SSH and its dependencies

The iOS and macOS apps link `apple/Packages/PersonaSSH` (the SSH tunnel to the hub, docs/operations/network.md), which depends on
the packages below. `Glue` and `ChannelDataUnwrapper` in `apple/Packages/PersonaSSH/Sources/PersonaSSH/Handlers.swift`
follow the `GlueHandler` and `SSHWrapperHandler` of swift-nio-ssh's `NIOSSHClient` example.

## JSch

The Android app's SSH tunnel to the hub (`android/core/hub/src/main/kotlin/persona/core/hub/tunnel/`,
docs/operations/network.md) uses JSch (https://github.com/mwiede/jsch, `com.github.mwiede:jsch`), which carries JZlib
(`com.jcraft.jsch.jzlib`) and jBCrypt (`com.jcraft.jsch.jbcrypt`) inside it. Authors' email addresses are left out of
the license texts.

## Lucide

The plan card's step marks (`web/src/views/chat/PlanCard.tsx`: circle, circle-check and the in-progress arc) and several
web icons drawn in `web/src/ui/icons.tsx` (sparkles, corner-down-right, workflow and others its comments name) take their

## cindy

`server/internal/assistant/models_catalog.json` (the built-in model catalog that fills in what a gateway lists) is taken from
cindy's model registry (`packages/model-providers/catalog/model-registry.json`): for the Claude series and the GLM,
Kimi, DeepSeek V4, Qwen3, MiniMax, Seed and MiMo models cindy runs on Claude Code, only the id, name, context window,
thinking levels (low, medium, high, xhigh, max) and default level, as the registry states them, reformatted to a flat
list. The provider settings (the add-a-provider steps, the connection test and the model list it fetches) and the web
chat's subagent and workflow cards (`web/src/views/chat/TaskCard.tsx`, after cindy's `AgentTaskCard`: layout, states and
wording) and the main chat's hand-off cards with the way-back strip on an Agent's page (`web/src/views/assistant/Handoff.tsx`,
`web/src/views/chat/HandoffBack.tsx`, after cindy's `SessionHandoffCard` and its return pill: layout, states and wording)
and a lead's Team side panel (`web/src/views/chat/TeamPanel.tsx`, after cindy's Team tab, `OrcaWorkerPanel` and its worker
strip: layout, states, wording and when it opens) follow cindy's design. No code is copied for those.

The web chat's work summary follows cindy's chat at the owner's request (2026-11-12): the timeline inside an opened
summary (`web/src/lib/work-groups.ts`, after `createCompletedWorkGroup` in `messageWorkGroups.ts`), the thought rows
(`web/src/views/chat/ThinkingRow.tsx`, after `ThinkingActivityRow` in `WorkGroupBlock.tsx`), the tool rows
(`web/src/views/chat/ActionRow.tsx`, after `AgentActionRow` and `activityRowChrome.ts`) and the durations (`workDuration`,
after `formatDuration`). Two files are ported from cindy's code with changes: `web/src/lib/thinking-text.ts` (from
`packages/maker-shared/src/thinkingText.ts`) and `web/src/views/chat/ThinkingText.tsx` (from
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/chat/ThinkingText.tsx`), with tests from cindy's.

The web chat's plan (`web/src/views/chat/PlanCard.tsx`, #5156) is ported from cindy's `TodoListCard.tsx` with changes:
the inline card that opens in place (`InlinePlanCard`), the pill above the composer with its hover / pinned flyout and
Close Plan (`TodoListCard`), the progress ring's arithmetic and the in-progress arc's path and sizes.

The changed-files card (`web/src/views/chat/TurnChanges.tsx`, #5157) and the error notice (`web/src/ui/ErrorNotice.tsx`)
are ported from cindy's `TurnChangesCard.tsx` and `components/ui/error-notice.tsx` with changes: their layout, sizes and
states; the counting, review targets and fold data are Persona's own.
