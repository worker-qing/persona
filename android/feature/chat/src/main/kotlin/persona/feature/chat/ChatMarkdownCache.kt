/**
 * The page's parsed Markdown (docs/android/android.md "Reply Markdown parsing"): one entry per id, the text it
 * was parsed from and its parse.
 *
 * What it keeps: every id the page's prewarm last asked to [keep], and the most recently used [OTHERS] ids besides
 * (thinking, plans, recaps, replies older than the prewarm's). So it holds at most the prewarm's set (its 80 replies'
 * text parts) plus [OTHERS]: about 112 entries, which at the ~19 bytes of parse per byte of reply measured on the JVM
 * (ChatMarkdownBench.retainedHeapPerEntry: 38 KB for a 2 KB reply, 294 KB for 16 KB, 1.15 MB for 64 KB) is about 4 MB
 * of 2 KB replies and 33 MB of 16 KB ones. A plain LRU as large as the prewarm's set lost all of it to the first other
 * text: the prewarm, walking its set in order, then evicted each entry just before it came back to it.
 *
 * One parse per id and text: a caller that asks while a parse of the same id and text is under way (the page's prewarm
 * and the row it warms, say) waits for that one. The parse runs in the cache's own [scope], so a caller that leaves (a
 * row scrolled away, a prewarm restarted) does not cancel it for the others or lose its work. Nor does the last caller
 * to leave: the cache keeps no count of who waits, so a parse runs to the end and is kept even when nobody waits for it
 * any more. That costs little, since a streaming reply parses only its tail.
 *
 * A streaming reply parses from its last settled block on ([ChatMarkdownStream]); once it ends, its final text is parsed
 * whole and kept under the same id.
